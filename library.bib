The argument in this article suggests that federal stability (robustness) requires for itself a well-functioning democratic process, which satisfies a fairly restrictive condition. A necessary condition for the resiliency of the federal regime is a representative democracy; furthermore, it is the representative democracy in which rewards to the representatives are only in part vested in their parochial constituencies, while in the other part come form other sources, e.g., from an oversized at-large coalition. The requirement to the democratic process is, of course, only a necessary, not a sufficient condition for the federal success. Yet, we argue in this essay that only the states with well-developed (properly institutionalized) democratic electoral competition have a chance to form a resilient federal union and sustain their federal constitutional arrangements not just in form, but in their political practice as well.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/422014},
	abstract = {Since the 1960s Juan J. Linz has been one of the world's foremost contributors to our understanding of democracy, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism. Although many of his contributions have had a significant impact, few have been as far-reaching as his essay "Presidential or Parliamentary Democracy: Does It Make a Difference?," originally written in 1985. The essay argued that presidentialism is less likely than parliamentarism to sustain stable democratic regimes. It became a classic even in unpublished form. Among both policymakers and scholars it spawned a broad debate about the merits and especially the liabilities of presidential government. Now that the definitive version of the essay has appeared, we believe that a critical appraisal is timely. This task is especially important because Linz's arguments against presidentialism have gained widespread currency. This article critically assesses Linz's arguments about the perils of presidential-ism. Although we agree with several of Linz's criticisms of presidentialism, we disagree that presidentialism is particularly oriented towards winner-takes-all results.' We argue that the superior record of parliamentary systems has rested partly on where parliamentary government has been implemented, and we claim that presi-dentialism has some advantages that partially offset its drawbacks. These advantages can be maximized by paying careful attention to differences among presidential systems. Other things being equal, presidentialism tends to function better where presidencies have weak legislative powers, parties are at least moderately disciplined, and party systems are not highly fragmented. Finally, we argue that switching from presidentialism to parliamentarism could exacerbate problems of governability in countries with undisciplined parties. Even if parliamentary government is more conducive to stable democracy, much rests on what kind of parliamentarism and presi-dentialism is implemented.2 By presidentialism we mean a regime in which, first, the president is always the chief executive and is elected by popular vote or, as in the U.S., by an electoral college with essentially no autonomy with respect to popular preferences and, second, the terms of office for the president and the assembly are fixed. Under pure presi-dentialism the president has the right to retain ministers of his or her choosing regardless of the composition of the congress. 449},

This study puts the protest survey design to the test by relying on data of 51 demonstrations (2009–2011) in seven European countries. We use data on 15,000 protest participants combined with screener questionnaires and extensive debriefing records of the interviewer teams. We account for noncontact (fieldwork problems), immediate and delayed refusal, and refusal bias. Results show that fieldwork problems are frequent, that immediate refusal is low, and that delayed refusal is considerable. Systematic refusal bias is only found for age and education. Differences between countries and protest issues are small but the issue determines the composition of an event which, in turn, leads to higher or lower refusal. Researchers should be cautious when using protest survey data to compare protest events across issues. The paper pleads for standardization and constant monitoring of the data-gathering process.},

We develop a theory of discursive eruption, referring to the ability of radical movements to initially ignite media coverage but not control the content once other actors— particularly those that can take advantage of journalistic norms—enter the discourse. We hold that one long-term outcome of radical social movements is the ability to alter discursive fields through mechanisms such as increasing the salience and content of movement-based issues. We examine the way movements shape discourse by focusing on newspaper articles about inequality before, during, and after the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. We analyze changes in the salience and content of coverage as well as shifts in actor standing and influence. Using 7,024 articles from eight newspapers, we find that the OWS movement increased media attention to inequality, shifting the focus of the discourse toward movement-based issue areas (e.g., the middle class and minimum wage). Further, we find that compared to the pre-OWS period, the influence of social movement organizations and think tanks rose in discourse on inequality. In addition, the discourse on inequality became more highly politicized as a result of the Occupy movement. These findings highlight the importance of social movements in shaping discourse and indicate that social movement scholars should further consider discursive changes as a consequence of social movements.},

We suggest a theoretical model of the rise and fall of public opposition in these movements over time. Quantitative indicators are developed and applied to this historical model. Rise and fall of controversy follows a regular sequence: Activities of protest leaders increase during periods of great national concern over issues that are complementary to the movement; during these periods, social and economic resources are relatively available to the movement. As the activity of protest leaders increases, mass media coverage of their activities increases. As mass media coverage increases, opposition to the technology among the wider public increases. As the activity of the leaders wanes, mass media coverage declines, and so does opposition among the wider public. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of this perspective for making predictions about the future course of 'specific' social movements.},

This supportive public opinion provides a valuable resource for the environmental movement, and the future of the movement will depend heavily on the degree to which environmentalists can effectively mobilize this support.},

We focus on cultural impacts that have mattered for movements? constituencies and address why movements have had those impacts.

	abstract = {Social movement studies and studies on civil society and, related to them, studies on voluntarism and the third sector, are burgeoning fields of knowledge, which have, however, only rarely interacted with each other. In fact, social movement scholars have devoted little attention to the concept of civil society, not even when addressing issues of “social capital”. Vice versa, civil society scholars have, with few exceptions, not considered social movements as cognate phenomena. This is all the more puzzling as there is instead ample theoretical and empirical overlapping, which calls for the building of bridges between these fields of study. In political and media discourse some organizations, individuals or events are defined interchangeably as linked to either social movements or civil society. In the social sciences, however, the core conceptualizations have pointed towards different elements as characterizing these phenomena. In particular, social movement studies can contribute to the literature on voluntarism a toolkit of concepts and theory oriented to understand social and political conflicts, learning from the literature on voluntarism about conceptions and practices of solidarity. In this article, I will address some (potential) interactions between the two fields, looking at differences and similarities in the conceptualizations of the two phenomena as well as in their empirical analysis as they have developed in time. I will first of all address conceptualizations in these cognate fields with attention to their theoretical developments. Then, I will point towards some recent trends that have blurred the distinction between social movements and civil society, voluntarism and third sector policies, looking in particular not only at more established analyses of NGOization of social movements, but also, and especially, of what can be defined as an SMOization of civil society—that is, the hybridization of more established civil society organizations into social movement organizations, especially when facing politicization in times of crises and increasing criminalization of solidarity activities.},

	abstract = {A transformation of basic political priorities may be taking place in Western Europe. I hypothesize: (1) that people have a variety of needs which are given high or low priority according to their degree of fulfillment: people act on behalf of their most important unsatisfied need, giving relatively little attention to needs already satisfied—except that (2) people tend to retain the value priorities adopted in their formative years throughout adult life. In contemporary Western Europe, needs for physical safety and economic security are relatively well satisfied for an unprecedentedly large share of the population. Younger, more affluent groups have been formed entirely under these conditions, and seem relatively likely to give top priority to fulfillment of needs which remain secondary to the older and less affluent majority of the population. Needs for belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment (characterized as “post-bourgeois” values) may take top priorities among the former group. Survey data from six countries indicate that the value priorities of the more affluent postwar group do contrast with those of groups raised under conditions of lesser economic and physical security. National patterns of value priorities correspond to the given nation's economic history, moreover, suggesting that the age-group differences reflect the persistence of preadult experiences, rather than life cycle effects. The distinctive value priorities imply distinctive political behavior—being empirically linked with preferences for specific political issues and political parties in a predictable fashion. If the respective age cohorts retain their present value priorities, we would expect long-term shifts in the political goals and patterns of political partisanship prevailing in these societies.},

Macro models emphasize the social location (e.g., new middle-class membership or social integration) of individuals as a source of public support for new social movements; psychological models focus on postmaterial values or problem perceptions as explanations of why citizens support protest movements. Despite the proliferation of explanatory models, however, research in this area suffers two shortcomings. First, several models remain untested, leaving it uncertain to what extent they are empirically valid. Second, most of the models remain disintegrated. Analyzing public opinion toward environmental groups in four nations, this research employs a Eurobarometer (1986) to test and synthesize various models. Postmaterial values, left policy orientations, and the perception of national pollution problems have the strongest direct influence on public evaluations of environmental organizations. Attributes that reflect the social integration of individuals indirectly influence environmental group evaluations via psychological factors. New middle-class explanations receive no support from my analyses.]},

Our analyses show that this new instrument captures meaningful variation across levels of identification with 20 major U.S. social movements and also helps distinguish among three movement identity clusters that largely align with key movement families. Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that our instrument has construct validity, as selected predictors explain variation in the three movement identity clusters in ways expected by previous research.

This study examines how citizens view scientists who publicly acknowledge values. Specifically, we investigate whether it matters: if citizens share or oppose a scientist’s values, if a scientist’s conclusions seem contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and if a scientist is assessing the state of the science or making a policy recommendation. We conducted two 3x2 factorial design online experiments. Experiment 1 featured a hypothetical scientist assessing the state of the science on the public-health effects of exposure to Bisphenol A (BPA), and Experiment 2 featured a scientist making a policy recommendation on use of BPA. We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and whether the scientist’s conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects’ values aligned with the scientist’s values. We analyzed our data with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether scientists make policy recommendations.},

These expected sanctions are suggested to explain the variance in people’s willingness to express a minority opinion across different social situations. An experiment showed that the expectation of being personally attacked can explain why people are more willing to voice a deviant opinion in offline rather than online environments. Findings also revealed that in contemporary social networking websites, wherein users commonly face a personally relevant audience, people are prone to hold back their opinion as they expect losing control over the reactions of their audience.

	abstract = {Information systems such as social media strongly influence public opinion formation. Additionally, communication on the internet is shaped by individuals and organisations with various aims. This environment has given rise to phenomena such as manipulated content, fake news, and social bots. To examine the influence of manipulated opinions, we draw on the spiral of silence theory and complex adaptive systems. We translate empirical evidence of individual behaviour into an agent-based model and show that the model results in the emergence of a consensus on the collective level. In contrast to most previous approaches, this model explicitly represents interactions as a network. The most central actor in the network determines the final consensus 60–70\% of the time. We then use the model to examine the influence of manipulative actors such as social bots on public opinion formation. The results indicate that, in a highly polarised setting, depending on their network position and the overall network density, bot participation by as little as 2–4\% of a communication network can be sufficient to tip over the opinion climate in two out of three cases. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which bots could shape the norms adopted by social media users.},

Once violence is over, the recovery of free speech and the exchange of opinions become a key area for peace studies. This exploratory study investigates the expression of opinions about the violence suffered once it has ended. We focus on the Basque Country where the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna group (ETA, Basque Homeland and Freedom) had been using political violence from 1959 to 2011. Using survey data (N = 257), we investigate how (1) the fear of being in a minority position, (2) the closeness to the reference groups, and (3) the interaction between both variables affect opinion expression. Results show that fear of being in a minority position about violence in the Basque Country decreases opinion expression and that closeness to the reference groups has direct and indirect effect on opinion expression. This study contributes, firstly, to the limited research on the political opinion expression about the violence experienced in the Basque Country, secondly, to the limited research on its peace process, and thirdly, by adopting as reference groups those resulting from the use of violence.},

To extend the theory’s relevance to social networking sites, we examined how users’ perceptions of network association, social presence, anonymity, and persistence related to opinion expression.

Given the uncertainty about sharing political views in social media, and the fact that social acceptance, or rejection, can be easily communicated through, for instance, likes, or a lack of likes, we argue that rejection sensitive individuals are less likely to share political information in social media. Combining an analysis of unique survey data on psychological characteristics and online political activity with focus group interviews with Swedish youth supports our argument, showing that rejection sensitive individuals are less inclined to engage politically in social media. The results extend on previous research by establishing the role of rejection sensitivity in political engagement in social media.},

This study also investigates the moderating roles of disagreement and publicness as two affordances on social media that influence the spiral of silence process. Results from the moderated mediation model with a panel lagged and autoregressive analysis suggest that fear of social isolation (FSI) has an indirect effect on discouraging disagreeing opinion expression but not supporting opinion expression and on encouraging withdrawal behaviors through enhancing willingness to self-censor (WTSC) on social media. This indirect effect is contingent on the levels of disagreement and publicness in one’s network. Higher levels of disagreement and publicness promote the spiral of silence.

Since most of the participants in this movement were students and NGO members, they had limited economic and political resources to influence policy change, which makes their success in stopping a trade deal remarkable. Many attribute this important success to an elite alliance with politicians inside the government, fueled by a personal rivalry between political elites. However, I argue that changing public opinion is the more important force behind the creation of the alliance. With original data from interviews with political elites, their staff members, and activists in Taiwan, in addition to secondary information, I confirm public opinion to be the major reason for the political alliance. This case illustrates that in some circumstances, public opinion outweighs the importance of elite rivalry in influencing political elite decision-making, and it could represent a key mechanism of democratic policy-making.},

But the effects are modified when the interactive nature of public opinion and electoral competition, and political party support and movement organizational strength, are tested. In particular, the effect of social movement organizations on ratification was amplified in the presence of elite allies, and legislators responded most to favorable public opinion under conditions of low electoral competition.

In addition, the link between feminist self-identification and some social attitudes is cohort specific: Seemingly profeminist positions distinguish self-identified feminists from nonfeminists only among members of the "second-wave" generation.

By drawing attention to movements' issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers' focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.},

Analyzing public opinion data from a nationally representative April 2000 Gallup Poll, we find substantial evidence of a progressive social movement ideology centered around the extension of rights within the American public, as support for individual movements within this family is highly interrelated. Adherents to this progressive social movement ideology are drawn from self-identified political Liberals and Democrats, the more highly educated, women, younger, and less religious adults. We argue that public opinion research should be seen as a valuable complement to existing case-based social movement scholarship.]},

Do we have government 'of the people, by the people, for the people?' Or is it those who have the resources to organize and pressure government who get what they want? In the first study ever of a random sample of policy proposals, Paul Burstein finds that the public can get what it wants - but mainly on the few issues that attract its attention. Does this mean organized interests get what they want? Not necessarily - on most issues there is so little political activity that it hardly matters. Politics may be less of a battle between the public and organized interests than a struggle for attention. American society is so much more complex than it was when the Constitution was written that we may need to reconsider what it means, in fact, to be a democracy.},

When the wider political environment contains an active, high-profile social movement with rapid shifts in public opinion occurring, the relationship between Congress and opinion appears to be less unidimensional than these options suggest. To test the relationship between Congress and public opinion on women's rights issues, we first coded and factor analyzed New York Times events data chronicling the degree of agitation on behalf of women's rights, 1950-86. We then compiled data examining legislative activity on laws addressing women as a group and public opinion about women's political role. These measures were used to evaluate alternative interpretations of the relationship between Congress and public opinion. Using a three-stage least squares model reinforced by several case studies of congressional activity on laws addressing women's issues, we conclude that during the time when there was an active women's movement, the relationship between Congress and public opinion was reciprocal. Congress and the women's movement competed for leadership of public opinion. Congress both led opinion and followed it, bringing about change that was swifter and less predictable than in normal periods of interest group politics.]},

	abstract = {Public opinion often depends on how elites choose to frame issues. For example, citizens’ opinions about a Ku Klux Klan rally may depend on whether elites frame the event as a free-speech issue or a public safety issue. Past research has focused largely on documenting the size of framing effects in uncontested settings. By contrast, there has been little research on framing in competitive environments in which individuals receive multiple frames representing alternative positions on an issue. We take an initial step toward understanding how frames work in competitive environments by integrating research on attitude structure and persuasion. Our theory of framing identifies the key individual and contextual parameters that determine which of many competing frames will have an effect on public opinion.Théorie sur le cadrage et la formation de l’opinion dans des environnements concurrentiels d’éliteDennis ChongDepartment of Political ScienceNorthwestern UniversityJames N. DruckmanDepartment of Political ScienceNorthwestern UniversityL’opinion publique est souvent tributaire de la manière dont les élites choisissent de cadrer les enjeux. Par exemple, l’opinion des citoyens à propos d’une manifestation du Ku Klux Klan peut dépendre du cadrage opéré par l’élite, selon que celui-ci montre l’événement comme un enjeux de liberté d’expression ou de sécurité publique. Dans le passé, la recherche a focalisé largement sur le fait de documenter l’importance que revêtent les effets du cadrage dans des contextes dénués de confrontation. Par contraste, peu de recherches ont porté sur le cadrage dans des environnements concurrentiels où les individus composent avec une multitude de cadrages traduisant diverses positions en regard d’une situation donnée. Nous effectuons une première démarche en vue de comprendre le fonctionnement des cadres dans les environnements concurrentiels, en intégrant la recherche sur la structuration de l’attitude et la persuasion. Notre théorie du cadrage identifie les principaux paramètres individuels et contextuels qui déterminent lesquels des nombreux cadres concurrents exerceront un effet sur l’opinion publique.Framing- und Meinungsbildungstheorie in konkurrenzbetonten EliteumgebungenDennis ChongDepartment of Political ScienceNorthwestern UniversityJames N. DruckmanDepartment of Political ScienceNorthwestern UniversityDie öffentliche Meinung hängt oft davon ab, wie ein Thema von Eliten geframt wird. Beispielsweise könnte die Meinung der Bürger über ein Ku Klux Klan Treffen davon beeinflusst sein, ob Eliten diese Veranstaltung als eine Thematik der freien Meinungsäußerung oder der öffentlichen Sicherheit rahmen. Forschungsaktivitäten haben sich bislang eher darauf konzentriert, das Ausmaß eines Framing-Effekts in eindeutig zuordenbaren Situationen zu dokumentieren. Im Gegensatz dazu gibt es wenig Forschungsbemühungen, die Framing-Effekte in konkurrenzbetonten Umgebungen untersuchen, in denen Individuen verschiedenen Frames aufgrund unterschiedlicher Positionen zu einem Thema ausgesetzt sind. Mit diesem Artikel unternehmen wir einen ersten Schritt hin zu einem besseren Verständnis von Frames in konkurrenzbetonten Umgebungen, indem wir Ansätze zur Einstellungsstruktur und Persuasion integrieren. Unsere Framing-Theorie identifiziert die individuellen und kontextualen Hauptparameter, die darüber entscheiden, welcher der konkurrierenden Frames einen Effekt auf die öffentliche Meinung haben wird.Una Teoría del Framing y la Formación de Opinión en Contextos Competitivos de ÉliteDennis ChongDepartamento de Ciencia Pol�ticaNorthwestern UniversityJames N.

Las investigaciones previas se han concentrado en documentar extensamente la envergadura de los efectos del framing en escenarios incontestados. En contraste, ha habido pocas investigaciones sobre el efecto del framing en contextos competitivos en los cuales los individuos reciben múltiples encuadres representando posiciones alternativas sobre un asunto. Tomamos un paso inicial hacia el entendimiento de cómo estos encuadres funcionan en un contexto competitivo mediante la integración de investigaciones sobre la estructura actitudinal y la persuasión.

	abstract = {A motivação inicial para a realização deste estudo foi apontar, de forma clara e compreensível, as enormes desigualdades que se manifestam entre negros e brancos e homens e mulheres nos mais diferentes espaços da sociedade (educação, mercado de trabalho, acesso a bens e serviços, etc). Nesse sentido, destaca-se, ainda, a situação a que mulheres negras, vítimas do racismo e do sexismo, estão submetidas, possuindo os piores indicadores em praticamente todas as áreas analisadas. Como mostra a pesquisa, hoje, no Brasil, 21\% das mulheres negras são empregadas domésticas e apenas 23\% delas têm Carteira de Trabalho assinada – contra 12,5\% das mulheres brancas que são empregadas domésticas, sendo que 30\% delas têm registro em Carteira de Trabalho. Outro dado alarmante é que 46,27\% das mulheres negras nunca passaram por um exame clínico de mama – contra 28,73\% de mulheres brancas que também nunca passaram pelo exame. Tanto mulheres negras quanto brancas que estão no mercado de trabalho têm escolaridade maior que a dos homens. Porém, isso não se reflete nos salários. A renda média mensal das mulheres negras no Brasil, segundo a última Pesquisa Nacional de Amostra por Domicílio, do IBGE (PNAD 2003), é de R\$ 279,70 – contra R\$ 554,60 para mulheres brancas, R\$ 428,30 para homens negros e R\$ 931,10 para homens brancos (veja os dados completos da pesquisa nas páginas a seguir ou no CD que acompanha o cartaz). Foi justamente em razão dos dados estatísticos como estes que o Estado brasileiro veio, na década de 1990, a reconhecer formalmente, perante a Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT), a existência de racismo, de discriminações baseadas na cor da pele ou na origem étnica dos indivíduos. Com o intuito de eliminar ou proibir as discriminações fundadas em gênero e raça, o Brasil assinou vários compromissos internacionais neste sentido, ratificou a CEDAW - Convenção para Eliminação de Todas as Formas de Discriminação contra a Mulher, o Protocolo Facultativo da CEDAW e quase todas as convenções da OIT. Também assinou uma das mais antiga convenções internacionais, a CERD – Convenção Internacional para a Eliminação da Desigualdade Racial. Além disto, a Constituição de 1988 traz em seu corpo uma série de preceitos que buscam garantir a igualdade entre todos e a não discriminação por qualquer motivo. São exemplos desta questão o artigo 5º da CF que diz: “Todos são iguais perante a lei, sem distinção de qualquer natureza, garantindo-se aos brasileiros e aos estrangeiros residentes no País a inviolabilidade do direito à vida, à liberdade, à igualdade, à segurança e à propriedade....” (art. 5º, caput). A Constituição deixa claro, também, que “homens e mulheres são iguais em direitos e obrigações...” (art. 5º, I). No art. 7º, inciso XXX, encontramos ainda: “proibição de diferença de salários, de exercício de funções e de critério de admissão por motivo de sexo, idade, cor ou estado civil”. Assim a presença de preconceitos e discriminações não é aceita no corpo jurídico do país. Entretanto os dados que estão apresentados neste conjunto de indicadores apontam para as enormes desigualdades que sofrem as mulheres, e em particular as mulheres negras. Esta violação aos direitos humanos torna-se ainda mais grave quando constatamos a magnitude da população brasileira que está sujeita, cotidianamente, a agressões, humilhações e outros tipos de violências baseadas na sua cor ou raça. Os comentários que se seguem não esgotam as possibilidades de informação e análise que o conjunto de indicadores oferecem, mas trata-se de apontar para algumas questões, cujo conhecimento e compreensão contribuem para esforços no sentido de modificar esta situação.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has organized hundreds of disruptive protests in American cities since 2013 (Garza 2014; Harris 2015; Taylor 2016). The movement has garnered considerable attention from the U.S. media and is well recognized by the U.S. public (Horowitz and Livingston 2016; Neal 2017). Social movement scholars suggest that such robust mobilizations are typically predicated on clear social movement frames (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). Tillery (2019b) has identified several distinct message frames within the social media communications of BLM activists. In this paper, we use a survey experiment to test the effect of three of these frames—Black Nationalist, Feminist, and LGBTQ+ Rights—on the mobilization of African Americans. We find that exposure to these frames generates differential effects on respondents’ willingness to support, trust, canvass, and write representatives about the Black Lives Matter movement.

Four frame alignment processes are identified and elaborated: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation.

	abstract = {For decades our common understanding of the organization of economic production has been that individuals order their productive activities in one of two ways: either as employees in firms, following the directions of managers, or as individuals in markets, following price signals. This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Ronald Coase and was developed most explicitly in the work of institutional economist Oliver Williamson. Recently, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old phenomenon called free software or open source software. This phenomenon involves thousands, or even tens of thousands, of computer programmers who collaborate on large- and small-scale projects without traditional firm-based or market-based ownership of the resulting product. This Article explains why free software is only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon emerging in the digitally networked. environment, a third mode of production that the author calls "commons-based peer production." The Article begins by demonstrating the widespread use of commons-based peer production on the Internet through a number of detailed examples, such as Wikipedia, Slashdot the Open Directory Project, and Google. The Article uses these examples to reveal fundamental characteristics of commons-based peer production that distinguish it from the property- and contract-based modes of firms and markets. The central distinguishing characteristic. is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals rather than market prices or managerial commands. The Article then explains why this mode has systematic advantages over markets and managerial hierarchies in the digitally networked environment when the object of production is information or culture. First, peer production has an advantage in what the author calls "information opportunity cost," because it loses less information about who might be the best person for a given job.

The Article concludes with an overview of how these models use a variety of technological, social, and formal strategies to overcome the collective action problems usually solved in managerial and market-based systems by property, contract, and managerial commands.},

Using national surveys and advances in opinion estimation, we create new estimates of state-level support for eight policies, including civil unions and nondiscrimination laws. We differentiate between responsiveness to opinion and congruence with opinion majorities. We find a high degree of responsiveness, controlling for interest group pressure and the ideology of voters and elected officials. Policy salience strongly increases the influence of policy-specific opinion (directly and relative to general voter ideology). There is, however, a surprising amount of noncongruence-for some policies, even clear supermajority support seems insufficient for adoption. When noncongruent, policy tends to be more conservative than desired by voters; that is, there is little progay policy bias. We find little to no evidence that state political institutions affect policy responsiveness or congruence.},

Connecting framing and sensemaking better enables us to examine how structural factors prompt and bound discursive processes, affecting when and where frame contests emerge. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by examining changes in the discourse of globalization. Using qualitative and quantitative analyses of newspaper articles and corporate press releases, we trace the emergence of globalization discourse, its diffusion, and the increasing contention that surrounds it. Our findings show how and where globalization discourse emerged in response to greater US. involvement with the international economy, and how later frame contests over the meaning of globalization have depended on the interests of the actors involved.},

Authorities react to social movement activities if and as they are depicted in the mass media, and conversely movement activists become aware of political opportunities and constraints through the reactions ( or non-reactions) that their actions provoke in the public sphere. The dynamics of this mediated interaction among political contenders can be analyzed as an evolutionary process. Of the great variety of attempts to mobilize public attention, only a few can be accommodated in the bounded media space. Three selection mechanisms-labelled here as "discursive opportunities" - can be identified that affect the diffusion chances of contentious messages: visibility ( the extent to which a message is covered by the mass media), resonance ( the extent to which others - allies, opponents, authorities, etc.-react to a message), and legitimacy ( the degree to which such reactions are supportive). The argument is empirically illustrated by showing how the strategic repertoire of the German radical right evolved over the course of the 1990s as a result of the differential reactions that various strategies encountered in the mass media arena.},

	volume = {89},
	issn = {0040-4411},
	abstract = {So-called independent agencies are created for a reason, and often that reason is a concern with agency capture. Agency designers hope that a more insulated agency will better protect the general public interest against interest group pressure. But the conventional approach to independent agencies in administrative law largely ignores why agencies are insulated. Instead, discussions about independent agencies in administrative law have focused on three features that have defined independent agencies: heads who are removable for cause by the President, an exemption from having to submit regulations to the President's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for cost-benefit analysis, and a multimember structure. But these traditional characteristics of an independent agency are not the only, or necessarily even the most effective, ways in which insulation from interest groups and partisan pressure can be achieved. In fact, under modern conditions of political oversight, other design elements and mechanisms are often just as important if the goal is to create an agency that is best suited to achieve a long-term public-interest mission free from capture. This is particularly true of agencies tasked with protecting the general public in the face of one-sided and intense political pressure. This kind of lopsided pressure can be seen in a range of areas, from criminal justice to consumer protection. The goal of this Article is to move the conversation about insulation beyond the traditional hallmarks of independence and identify overlooked elements of agency design, deemed "equalizing factors," that are particularly well-suited to addressing the problem of capture in the context of asymmetrical political pressure. The Article identifies five such equalizing factors that have received little or no attention in the legal literature on independent agencies but that are critically important for insulation against one-sided interest group dominance. The Article then compares the effectiveness of traditional and equalizing factors in the context of consumer protection, an area with the kind of one-sided interest group pressure that is a breeding ground for capture. The Article explores the relationship between the institutional design of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and its effectiveness and uses those lessons to analyze the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the most significant new federal agency created in decades. This analysis of consumer protection regulatory agencies showcases both the continuing danger of capture and the critical importance of institutional design in policing it.},

Specifically, I use the social movement framing literature to analyze how the organizations strategically construct media frames and packages in response to opposition, the tactics they use to get media coverage, and the relative success of each organization's efforts in mass media outlets. The analysis suggests that an organization's media strategy matters, but that organizational structure and organizational identity color these strategies. One of the best ways to develop press relations is to know how a particular newspaper or broadcast station operates. Make friends with reporters or newscasters who are sympathetic to the issues.

	abstract = {It is an enduring belief in American politics that legislators who ”bring home the bacon” are rewarded for their efforts at the ballot box. Most researchers, however, have been unsuccessful in corroborating empirically a relationship between allocations to member districts and reelection margins. Previous research may have failed to detect a relationship due to misconceptualization, misspecified empirical tests, or both. We argue that not all legislators have the same incentives to utilize pork-barrel strategies to enhance their electoral margins. Furthermore the extent to which voters are influenced by the provision of distributive benefits is likely to depend on the attentiveness of voters to politics, their interest group affiliations, and their sources of political information. In short, both the predisposition to engage in pork-barrel strategies and their effects are likely to be conditional. Hypotheses derived from this respecification of the electoral connection thesis are tested with a data base that combines information on domestic assistance awards to congressional districts, information about members of Congress, and the political knowledge and group affiliations of individual voters. We find that only some incumbents, namely those who are most vulnerable, are likely to seek increases in new awards. Certain constituents, those who are politically attentive members or interest groups are most likely to be aware of new awards to the district and to more favorably evaluate the incumbent as a result. Most members of general public remain indifferent to alterations in the flow of new awards.},

Rather, social movements and protest tactics are more often part of a portfolio of efforts by politically active leaders and groups to influence politics. Indeed, as representative governance spreads, with the conviction by all parties that governments should respond to popular choice, then social movements and protest will also spread, as a normal element of democratic politics. Social movements should therefore not be seen as simply a matter of repressed forces fighting states; instead they need to be situated in a dynamic relational field in which the ongoing actions and interests of state actors, allied and counter-movement groups, and the public at large all influence social movement emergence, activity, and outcomes.},

	abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that the degree of social cohesion is an important determinant of population health status. Citizens living in societies with a high degree of social cohesion - characterized by strong social networks and high levels of interpersonal trust seem to be healthier than those living in socially disorganized societies. Epidemiologists have become interested in notions of civil society and social capital to explain variations in health across societies. The purpose of the present paper was to examine the role of social capital in the Russian mortality crisis. Social capital has been defined as those features of social organization - such as the density of civic associations, levels of interpersonal trust, and norms of reciprocity - that act as resources for individuals, and facilitate collective action. A civil society is one that is rich in stocks of social capital. Various scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Soviet regime was the paucity of civil society. Using household survey data from the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion research (VTsIOM), we carried out a cross-sectional, ecologic analysis of the association between indicators of social capital and mortality rates across 40 regions of Russia. We found associations between indicators of social capital (mistrust in government, crime, quality of work relations, civic engagement in politics) and life expectancy, as well as mortality rates. In the absence of civil society, it is believed that far more people in post-Soviet Russia rely on informal sources of support (friends, family) to deal with their day to day problems. Those lacking such sources of support may have been especially vulnerable to the economic hardships following the transformation to a market economy. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To test this hypothesis, I generate a new over-time measure of the public's support for being tough on crime. The analysis suggests that, controlling for the crime rate, illegal drug use, inequality, and the party in power, since 1953 public opinion has been a fundamental determinant of changes in the incarceration rate. If the public's punitiveness had stopped rising in the mid-1970s, the results imply that there would have been approximately 20\% fewer incarcerations. Additionally, an analysis of congressional attention to criminal justice issues supports the argument that the public's attitudes have led, not followed, political elites.},

We show that when the production of a public good is a Volunteer's Dilemma, in which a fixed number of cooperators is necessary to produce the public good, cooperators and defectors persist in a mixed equilibrium, without iterations and without relatedness. This mixed equilibrium is absent in the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma, in which the public good is a linear function of the individual contributions. We also show that the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Volunteer's Dilemma are the two opposite extremes of a general public goods game, and that all intermediate cases can have a mixed equilibrium like the Volunteer's Dilemma. The coexistence of cooperators and defectors, therefore, is a typical outcome of most social dilemmas, which requires neither relatedness nor iterations.},

We focus on whether gender-of-interviewer effects are evident, whether they vary by respondent gender, and whether they vary across several attitudinal domains relevant to gender inequality. While many items do not show statistically significant gender-of-interviewer effects, we document significant effects across a variety of items. When such effects are evident, they tend to involve both male and female respondents expressing more egalitarian gender-related attitudes or greater criticism of existing gender inequalities to female interviewers. Male respondents offer significantly different responses to male and female interviewers on questions dealing with gender inequality in employment. For female respondents, interviewer-gender effects are evident for items addressing gender-related collective action, policy, and group interests. Using multivariate models that allow us to represent both respondent-level and interviewer-level variables, we find that interviewer-gender effects are statistically significant in most attitudinal domains but that the interaction between interviewer gender and respondent gender does not tend to be statistically significant. We consider the implications of these findings both for understanding the survey process and for understanding gender relations more generally.},

In social movement scholarship, attention itself is rarely examined directly; rather, it is encountered in the study of means of delivering attention such as mass media or celebrities. This conflation of the resource, attention, and the pathways to acquire it, such as mass media, was less of an analytic problem when mass media enjoyed a near monopoly on public attention. However, the paths connecting movement actors and public attention are increasingly multiplex and include civic and social media. In this article, I examine the concept of attention as a distinct analytic category, reevaluate social movement scholarship in light of weakening of the monopoly on public attention, and introduce and examine a novel dynamic brought about by emergent attention economy: networked microcelebrity activism. I examine this novel dynamic through case studies and raise questions for future exploration.},

The article considers possible testable hypotheses concerning the outcomes of collective action which can be derived from intergroup research and from the synthesis of the three disciplines.

This result is puzzling because the anti-ACTA side controlled few material resources and should have found it difficult to have its voice heard on an issue negotiated at the international level. We explain the success of the anti-ACTA campaign by showing how interest groups managed to increase the public salience of the issue; how the increasing public salience motivated a growing number of interest groups to mobilize; and how the resulting dynamic made decision-makers opt against ratification of the agreement.

We find that SMOs were decisive in adoption of affirmative action, but not comparable worth policies. In contrast, institutional activists were important for the passage of comparable worth but not affirmative action policies. These findings suggest that resource mobilization theory would better capture the impact of social movements on policy outcomes by recognizing activists who work as insiders on outsider issues.},

In addition, by drawing on the concept of relational transformation in psychological crowds, I show how an emergent shared social identity can engender a range of further behavioural and cognitive consequences that contribute to collective self-organisation in emergencies, including expected support, coordination of behaviour, and collective efficacy. It will be argued that the model can been applied to explaining how potentially dangerous crowd events avoid disaster: shared social identity operates as the basis of spontaneous self-organisation in these cases, as in many emergencies and disasters.},

The resulting changes in production relations led to the disappearance of traditional public spaces and meeting places such as open squares, workplaces, party offices or the premises of groups involved in the antagonistic, ie anti-capitalist and anti-fascist, movement. Within this context, in the 1980s and 1990s, these groups managed to create new social and political spaces by setting up Self-Managed Social Centers (CSAs), ie squatted properties which became the venue of social, political and cultural events. Over 250 Social Centers have been active in Italy over the past 15 years, especially in urban areas. Their organizational modes are examples of successful direct democracy in non-hierarchical structures and may provide alternative options to the bureaucratic organization of so many aspects of social and political life. Point number one on a Social Center's agenda is a daunting task: it must renovate and refurbish privately or publicly owned empty properties and turn them into public spaces open to the general public. For this task it relies exclusively on collective action, ie cooperative working modes which do not come under the provisions governing regular employment contracts and can thus be used to combat marginalization and exclusion processes which are becoming more and more dramatic in our cities. An analysis of the evolution of this original Italian movement provides the opportunity to address a number of issues associated with alternative practices to neoliberal globalization.},

The presence of resourceful civil rights organizations in a county can lead to higher numbers of reported hate crimes, but the influence of civil rights organizations is contingent upon the political context and upon objective conditions that lend credibility to civil rights framing.},

It highlights the large gap between the scientific community and the general public in terms of their understanding, awareness and perception of risks associated with climate change. Awareness is driven both by environmental values or political and economic agendas; particularly important are worldviews and 'myths of nature', which have a great impact on risk perception. Attitudes are further complicated because the problem of climate change comprises a form of 'post-normal science': it needs to be viewed holistically, with consideration of the feedbacks between the climate system, the human system and ecosystems; there is large uncertainty and a plurality of legitimate perspectives; and the issue is complex and difficult or impossible to fit into a traditional linear problem-solving model. It is therefore not a rational decision for most individuals to take actions to reduce risk from climate change in the absence of collective action, yet collective action is extraordinarily difficult to achieve. The benefits of risk reduction also fall primarily upon future generations, while uncertainties mean that differences in perspective, and problems of poor communication, misinformation and unstated assumptions tend to cloud the social discourse.},

Here the authors test some of Freeman's assumptions regarding what political mechanisms could account for what he sees as a persistent 'gap' between expansionist policies and restrictive public opinion through recourse to original empirical evidence. Their findings largely go against Freeman's predictions. Immigration is an elite-led highly institutionalised field with a relatively weak level of civil society engagement. Elites dominate the field and hold a decisively restrictionist stance. This points toward an explanation where the direction of immigration policies is not an outcome of an organised pro-migrant lobby winning over a resource-weak diffuse anti-migrant lobby, as Freeman suggests, but determined in a relatively autonomous way by political elites.},

I argue that governments create judicial institutions to help solve collective action problems endemic to operating under a common regulatory regime. Once established, a court in its institutional "infancy" is capable of facilitating compliance with that regulatory regime's rules but only consistent with the purpose for which the governments created the court. And finally, once the court has earned the trust of a government's public, its ability to enforce the regulatory regime's rules qualitatively expands. In demonstrating this last point, I derive how and why publics can rationally come to believe that supporting a court, if there was a conflict between its government and the court, would be in that public's interest.},

Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger as a point of departure for its analysis. These cases are opt for such a discussion because they generated scores of amicus briefs and numerous public opinion polls and, most important for this analysis, featured a group of intervenors styling itself a "mass movement" for social justice. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this Article considers the Grutter intervenors' experience in light of social movement history and the social science and legal literature on mass movements. Challenging the legal literature, this Article concludes that social movements and juridical law are fundamentally in tension. The legal literature assumes not only that the two are compatible, but also that rights talk is especially inspirational to, and efficacious for, social movements. This view overlooks an important distinction between the definitional and inspirational roles that law in the courts can play in protest movements. Social movements may profitably use rights talk to inspire political mobilization, although less successfully than legal mobilization theorists assume. But social movements that define themselves through law risk undermining their insurgent role in the political process, and thus losing their agenda-setting ability. Viewed within this framework, the Grutter "mass movement" failed to significantly impact the constitutional order. Instead, the intervenors engaged in a single-issue political and legal reform campaign, which achieved only moderate success. Their limited success demonstrates the tension between social movement tactics and litigation as tools of social change.},

Based on a review of the relevant literature, we predict that modern expressions of prejudice are less likely to be perceived as indicating group-based disadvantage and hence elicit less anger, protest, and collective action than old-fashioned prejudice. We present three studies to offer empirical support for this prediction. In Study 1 (N = 116), female participants were led to believe that the general public endorses either old-fashioned or modern sexist views. In Study 2 (N = 44) and 3 (N = 37) female participants were exposed to a student supervisor who allegedly held either old-fashioned or modern sexist views. Results of all three studies indicate that modern sexism is less likely to be perceived as a form of discrimination, and as a result elicits less anger at the source and less support for collective action (Study 1), intentions to protest (Study 2), and collective protest behavior (Study 3) than old-fashioned sexism. In discussing the results of this research, we connect to current insights on antecedents of collective action, and identify conclusions from our analysis that are relevant for societal and organizational policy making.},

Based on two proposed functions of social identity performance (Klein, Spears, \& Reicher, 2007), we distinguished between the efficacy of collective action at consolidating the identity of a protest movement and its efficacy at achieving social change (political efficacy). We expected identity consolidation efficacy to positively predict collective action tendencies directly and indirectly via political efficacy. We also expected collective action tendencies to be positively predicted by moral outrage and by sympathy in response to disadvantaged outgroup's suffering. These hypotheses were supported in two surveys examining intentions to protest for Palestine in Britain (Study 1), and intentions to attend the June 4th vigil in Hong Kong to commemorate the Tiananmen massacre among a sample of Hong Kong citizens (Study 2). The contributions of these findings to research on the dual pathway model of collective action and the different functions of collective action are discussed.},

This analysis examines how the determinants of abortion attitudes have changed between 1977 and 1996, using data from the General Social Surveys. While in early time periods, whites were more approving of abortion than blacks, that pattern had reversed by the late 1980s. After controlling for other factors, older people are more accepting of abortion throughout the two decades, while gender is generally unrelated to abortion views. Catholic religion weakens slightly as a predictor of abortion attitudes, while religious fundamentalism and political liberalism increase in explanatory power. The associations between attitudinal correlates and abortion approval also change over this time period. Religiosity becomes a less powerful predictor of abortion attitudes, while respondents' attitude toward sexual freedom and belief in the sanctity of human life increase in their predictive power. Support for gender inequality remains a weak but stable predictor of abortion attitudes. This pattern of results suggests that the public is influenced more by the pro-life framework of viewing abortion than by the pro-choice perspective.},

This study is motivated by this particular issue and examines the effectiveness of astroturf organizations in the global warming context, wherein large corporate polluters have an incentive to set up astroturf organizations to undermine the importance of human activities in climate change. We conduct an experiment to determine whether astroturf organizations have an impact on the level of user certainty about the causes of global warming. Results show that people who used astroturf websites became more uncertain about the causes of global warming and humans' role in the phenomenon than people who used grassroots websites. Astroturf organizations are hence successful in promoting business interests over environmental protection.

An inductive study of the rise of Cubism, a revolutionary paradigm that overthrew classic principles of representation in art, results in a model where not only the periphery moves toward the core through collective action, as typically asserted, but the core also moves toward the periphery, becoming more receptive to radical ideas. The fragmentation of the art market in early 20th-century Paris served as the trigger. The proliferation of market niches and growing ambiguity over evaluation standards dramatically reduced the costs of experimentation in the periphery and the ability of the core to suppress radical ideas. A multilevel analysis linking individual creativity, peer networks, and the art field reveals how market developments fostered Spanish Cubist Pablo Picasso's experiments and facilitated their diffusion in the absence of public support, a coherent movement, and even his active involvement. If past research attests to the importance of framing innovations and mobilizing resources in their support, this study brings attention to shifts in the structure of opportunities to do so.},

The analysis builds on original survey data of more than 400 NGOs involved in five different IOs, complemented by elite interviews with IO and state officials. Secondly, the article advances a specific argument about how the strategic exchange of information and access between NGOs and IOs increases NGO influence in IOs. This argument, derived from theories of lobbying in American and European politics, is contrasted with three alternative explanations of NGO influence, privileging material resources, transnational networks and public opinion mobilization, and the broader implications of these results for research on NGOs in global governance are explored.},

Noelle-Neumann 1984). This study investigated the role of opinion thresholds, social groups and weighing of others' opinions in opinion expression. Using Krassa's (1988) computer simulation and modification of Noelle-Neumann's (1974) spiral of silence as a base, we test several theoretical modifications to the spiral of silence model using data gathered from people living in or near six national parks in Canada.

The data show that the elite and interest group paths are least used, paths based on the news media and elected officials are most used, with mass opinion sources of moderate importance. Further data show that the use of any one path depends to some extent upon the types of issues with which officials deal, and the institutional position and ideology of individual officials. Foreign policy officials are often skeptical about public opinion polls; however, in using their own alternative ”operational” sources, such officials may be more receptive to public input than previously thought. The results of this study are compared with Bernard Cohen's The Public's Impact a Foreign Policy (1973).

In the American state politics context, diffusion is commonly conceptualized as a dyadic process whereby states adopt policies (in part) because other states have adopted them. This implies a policy diffusion network connecting the states. Using a dataset of 187 policies, we introduce and apply an algorithm that infers this network from persistent diffusion patterns.

In this paper, I use histories of peace protest and analyses of the inside of these social movements and theoretical work on protest cycles to explain cycles of movement engagement and quiescence in terms of their relation to external political context, or the 'structure of political opportunity.” I begin with a brief review of the relevant literature on the origins of movements, noting parallels in die study of interest groups. Building on recent literature on political opportunity structure, I suggest a theoretical framework for understanding the lifecycle of a social movement that emphasizes the interaction between activist choices and political context, proposing a six-stage process through which challenging movements develop. Using this theoretical framework I examine the four cases of relatively broad antinuclear weapons mobilization in postwar America.

On the basis of such techniques, recommendations have been formulated in relation to environmental policy. However, the exposure of weaknesses in this method has led economists to look to other information-gathering approaches which might enhance, and/or complement, environmental valuation. One such approach is that of 'citizens' juries' (CJs). A CJ consists of a small group of people, selected to represent the general public rather than any interest group or sector, which meets to deliberate upon a policy question. This approach may complement traditional approaches to data gathering on public preferences for environmental goods and services by addressing some of the concerns that have been voiced regarding existing methods. First, CJs may be useful in tackling the problem of information provision, and concerns relating to the level of understanding of the respondent. Second, CJs may be a means of addressing the 'citizen value versus consumer value' argument in environmental valuation. Third, CJs may help researchers understand how participants construct their values. Fourth, this approach allows sustainability issues to be addressed explicitly. The authors also discuss a number of problems associated with CJs and conclude with examples from two recent juries on environmental issues which were held in Scotland, and make recommendations on how environmental economists might utilise this tool.},

Decision-making procedures providing different interest groups with equal opportunities to voice their opinions instigate more trust in the decision maker and, in turn, lead to greater willingness to accept decisions compared to no-voice procedures (i.e.. unilateral decision-making Study I) and unequal group-voice procedures when one type of interest group receives voice, but another type of interest group does not Study 2). Study 3 further shows that an individual's own level of knowledge about CCS moderates the desire for an opportunity for members of the general public to voice opinions in the decision-making process, inferred trustworthiness of decision makers, and policy acceptance. These results imply that people care about voice in decision-making even when they are not directly personally involved in the decision-making process. We conclude that people tend to use procedural information when deciding to accept or oppose policy decisions on political complex issues: hence, it is important that policymakers use fair group-voice procedures and that they communicate to the public how they arrive at their decisions.},

Popular agitation first alerts concerned officials to poor policy implementation and may prompt them to take corrective steps. As a result of participating in contention, certain activists feel empowered and become more likely to take part in future challenges, whereas others feel disillusioned and lapse into passivity. In the course of observing collective action, some onlookers are sensitized to protesters' concerns and public opinion is affected. Without popular action, better implementation, biographical change, and effects on the public would not emerge, but nor would they without involvement from above. Studying the impact of this protest thus sheds light on two issues that have long troubled students of contentious politics: (a) how to get a grip on indirect, mediated consequences; and (b) how to think about causality when change is a result of popular action as well as openings provided by sympathetic elites.},

The structural positions of groups are identified over time, and we show that a group's position influences the protest repertoire employed. Central groups in all periods define which repertoires are most dominant, and more peripheral groups appear as innovators. Using the structural positions of groups as a test of their salience, some of the predictions of the new social movement theory - that identity has replaced interest as the determinant of social protest, and that organized labor's role has declined - are tested. We find support for the first claim, and falsify the second. While new social movement groups have become more central in the world of social protest, the role of labor has not changed relative to its position in the early 1960s. Finally, we develop some of the implications of the modeling strategy employed. Basic is the recognition that movement scholars be more sensitive to the context in which protests occur. This context is the structure of social protest.},

Our analysis provides evidence for direct influence of visibility of the organization and its main issue on membership support, while membership support does not influence visibility of an SMO and its issue. Furthermore, an SMO's media visibility is negatively affected by the visibility of other SMOs within the same sector.

In support of his position, Professor Zelinsky presents empirical research indicating that the direct monetary largesse dispensed to four important interest groups substantially exceeds the tax benefits they receive, that Congress' tax-writers are less dependent for campaign contributions on particular interests than the members of Congress' direct expenditure committees, and that the general press makes the congressional tax-writing panels visible to the public at-large, while the trade press covers the direct expenditure committees more intensely for its specialized readership.},

However, this collective action is precluded by the 'consensus gap' between scientific knowledge and public opinion. Here, we test the extent to which the iconic cities around the world are likely to shift in response to climate change. By analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we test if their climate in 2050 will resemble more closely to their own current climate conditions or to the current conditions of other cities in different bioclimatic regions. Even under an optimistic climate scenario (RCP 4.5), we found that 77\% of future cities are very likely to experience a climate that is closer to that of another existing city than to its own current climate. In addition, 22\% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. As a general trend, we found that all the cities tend to shift towards the sub-tropics, with cities from the Northern hemisphere shifting to warmer conditions, on average similar to 1000 km south (velocity similar to 20 km. year(-1)), and cities from the tropics shifting to drier conditions. We notably predict that Madrid's climate in 2050 will resemble Marrakech's climate today, Stockholm will resemble Budapest, London to Barcelona, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Tokyo to Changsha. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. The global assessment of city analogues can facilitate the understanding of climate change at a global level but also help land managers and city planners to visualize the climate futures of their respective cities, which can facilitate effective decision-making in response to on-going climate change.},

	abstract = {Partisanship has a powerful influence on political behavior in the United States, but its influence is less certain in European democracies. Part of the debate concerning the influence of partisanship in Europe centers on its nature. From one perspective, partisanship is seen as grounded in factors such as ratings of government performance and agreement with the party's issue stances. We refer to this as the instrumental model. In the United States, however, a competing model has gained empirical support in which partisanship is defined as an identity that is largely defensive in nature and not especially reactive to ongoing events. We refer to this as an expressive model. In this review, we focus on several European democracies (the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy) and evaluate evidence for and against an expressive model of partisanship in which democratic citizens act to defend their party in order to maintain its positive standing. We find evidence that strong partisans in Europe exhibit five characteristics of expressive partisans: stable partisan identity, motivated reasoning in defense of the party, the greater influence of identity than issues and ideology in shaping vote choice and political behavior, affective polarization bias in favor of one's own party, and the existence of strong defensive emotions aroused by partisan threats and reassurances. It appears that partisans in the four European democracies act in similar ways to partisans in the United States. Nonetheless, levels of partisan identification differ across the European nations and between European nations and the United States helping to explain national differences in the intensity of partisan behavior.},

We analyze several Congressional votes relevant to four episodes of US humanitarian intervention: Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo. We find that public support for humanitarian intervention increases Congressional support and that other political demands, primarily partisanship and ideological distance from the president, often trump the normative exigencies of intervention. Our findings shed light on the domestic political dynamics behind humanitarian intervention and can help explain why some recent humanitarian missions have proceeded without seeking Congressional approval.},

In this article, we take stock of current psychological approaches to the study of climate change to explore what is social about climate change from the perspective of psychology. Drawing from current interdisciplinary perspectives and emerging empirical findings within psychology, we identify four distinct features of climate change and three sets of psychological processes evoked by these features that are fundamentally social and shape both individual and group responses to climate change. Finally, we consider how a more nuanced understanding of the social underpinnings of climate change can stimulate new questions and advance theory within psychology.},

This effect occurs regardless of a group's goals or organizational nature. The theory is tested using a generalized estimating equation to account for multiple attacks by several groups. The study finds that the religious ideology of a group greatly increases the number of deaths from a suicide attack, even if varying group motivations and structural factors are taken into account.

These initiatives provide a valuable opportunity to understand how economic self-interest, geography, interest group endorsements, and public goods affect citizen support for development policies.

Through a new measure of 'mobilized dissent', we find evidence that the level of interest group pluralism in financial regulatory policymaking is constrained by the limited mobilization of voices outside of the business community. We analyse how mobilized dissent towards the regulated financial industry changes in response to different institutional environments. While technical complexity, institutional context and the global financial crisis are found to impact the level of mobilized dissent, the impact of these environmental conditions varies across different groups. This analysis reveals not only that organized opposition to the financial industry is relatively weak, but also that it is relatively disjointed.},

Results show that laking account of public opinion does not generally make any difference in the finding of direct effect. . However, the role of public opinion varies across the measures of organizational resources and activity.

Environmentalism is also considered a key "new social movement" (NSM), assumed to share fundamental characteristics with other NSMs such as the women's, antinuclear, and peace movements. Using the results of a 1990 cross-national survey of western Europe and the United States, we examine three broad suppositions regarding public support for the environmental movement and other NSMs. We first examine the idea that the general public distinguishes between two branches of contemporary environmentalism-the more traditional one of nature conservation and the newer, broader one of general environmental protection-and find that the general publics in 18 nations make little distinction between them. We next examine the degree to which public support for environmental protection is related to support for other NSMs, and find a strong relationship between the two-thereby validating a widely assumed but seldom-tested tenet found in the NSM literature. Finally, we examine the presumed bases of support for environmental protection and other NSMs, particularly the notion that NSM supporters are drawn heavily from the "new class." We find that demographic variables, including membership in the new class, are poor predictors of support for the goals of NSMs in general and of support for environmentalism in particular.},

	abstract = {News media coverage can affect how Americans view health policy issues. While previous research has investigated the text content of news media coverage of obesity, these studies have tended to ignore the photographs and other images that accompany obesity-related news coverage. Images can convey important messages about which groups in society are more or less affected by a health problem, and, in turn, shape public understanding about the social epidemiology of that condition. In this study, we analyzed the images of overweight and obese individuals in Time and Newsweek coverage over a 25-year period (1984-2009), and compared these depictions, which we characterize as representing the "news media epidemiology" of obesity, to data describing the true national prevalence of obesity within key populations of interest over this period. Data collected included descriptive features of news stories and accompanying images, and demographic characteristics of individuals portrayed in images. Over the 25-year period, we found that news magazines increasingly depicted non-whites as overweight and obese, and showed overweight and obese individuals less often performing stereotypical behaviors. Even with increasing representation of non-whites over time, news magazines still underrepresented African Americans and Latinos. In addition, the elderly were starkly underrepresented in images of the overweight and obese compared to actual prevalence rates. Research in other policy arenas has linked media depictions of the populations affected by social problems with public support for policies to combat them. Further research is needed to understand how news media depictions can affect public stigma toward overweight and obese individuals and public support for obesity prevention efforts.

	abstract = {This article discusses climate change knowledge from the perspective of social movement theory, a relatively neglected topic in the literature on climate change knowledge. This article reviews relevant studies and theories of social movements with special attention to the role of knowledge-making in social movements, before tracing the relations between social movements and climate change knowledge from the 1970s to the present. Climate change first emerged as an issue of public concern within the context of the environmental movements of the 1970s and 1980s, while skepticism was shaped, in significant ways, by the neo-conservative and neo-nationalist movements that grew to political significance in the 1980s and 1990s. The neo-liberal movements of the 1990s and 2000s have helped shape the recent rise to public attention of climate change as an overarching political problem. Finally, this article discusses how concerns with 'climate justice' have emerged as part of a social movement for global justice, and concludes by contrasting the different social movements that have affected and influenced the making of climate change knowledge.

To learn about the claims that policy elites make, we examined statements the president and members of Congress, experts, and interest group leaders in congressional hearings made about Social Security. To learn about opinion data on Social Security, we conducted a Lexis-Nexis search of the archives of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Our analyses show that policy elites discussing Social Security did invoke public opinion. Contrary to our expectations, however, few of the elite invocations of public opinion cited specific surveys or concrete facts about the distribution of opinion. Although claims directly contradicting survey evidence were relatively rare, only with the rather few specific claims by congressional elites did we find much clear-cut support in the available polling data. Relatively seldom could we find clear-cut support for the elites' general claims. Moreover, some of the most frequent claims about public opinion-including the UFO story and alleged public support for privatization-could have been contested but seldom were. The highly visible and well-polled case of Social Security suggests that specific, data-based elite invocations of public opinion may be even less common on other, lower-visibility and less-polled issues. It also suggests that survey research professionals might do well to intensify their scrutiny of public discourse about public opinion and to increase their efforts to bring scientific expertise to bear upon such discourse.},

The paper aims to make two contributions to the Dialectic Issue LifeCycle (DILC) model, which captures the dynamics of socio-political mobilization around societal problems and industry responses. First, the five phases in the DILC-model are elaborated with insights from social movement theory, political science, public attention, issue management, corporate political strategy, and innovation management. Second, a 'cyclical' lifecycle pattern is explored, in which a social problem does not linearly progress through successive phases, but can also move 'backwards' if public attention or political will decrease. We explore these contributions with a longitudinal study of the car-safety problem and responses from American automakers (1900-1995). We use a combined quantitative qualitative method that employs coupled time-series analyses as support for an in-depth case study. The case study showed that the industry long denied the influence of car design on fatalities, and reluctantly changed its position in the mid-1960s (under pressure from public opinion and policy-makers). In the late-1980s, when markets emerged because safety became part of consumer preferences, the industry implemented comprehensive changes in technology, beliefs and mission. (C) 2014 The Authors.

In keeping with these traditions, they argue that, when faced with emergent social threats, members of society seek to clarify ambiguous and often conflicting information about such threats through affiliation. The process through which ambiguous social information gets interpreted closely resembles the ways in which social movements arrive at interpretive frames that ready participants for action. Thus, whether or not a social object becomes deviantized depends on a complex process of social construction involving active, not merely reactive, efforts by social actors (contrary to traditional images of "panic").},

Results. Religion is a significant factor in abortion policy, but not in simple ways. The impact of conservative Protestants is indirect, through public opinion: states with many evangelical Protestants have more people with pro-life attitudes. In contrast, the impact of Catholics is both direct and indirect: there is a direct pro-life impact, that is not mediated by public opinion, which reflects the capacity to lobby state governments, and an indirect pro-choice impact through provoking larger state memberships in the National Abortion Rights Action League in states with many Catholics. Conclusions. While there is one Roman Catholic church, with a diverse membership but unified leadership and doctrine on the abortion issue, there are many conservative Protestant churches with no unified leadership.

When the wider political environment contains an active, high-profile social movement with rapid shifts in public opinion occurring, the relationship between Congress and opinion appears to be less unidimensional than these options suggest. To test the relationship between Congress and public opinion on women's rights issues, we first coded and factor analyzed New York Times events data chronicling the degree of agitation on behalf of women's rights, 1950-86. We then compiled data examining legislative activity on laws addressing women as a group and public opinion about women's political role. These measures were used to evaluate alternative interpretations of the relationship between Congress and public opinion. Using a three-stage least squares model reinforced by several case studies of congressional activity on laws addressing women's issues, we conclude that during the time when there was an active women's movement, the relationship between Congress and public opinion was reciprocal. Congress and the women's movement competed for leadership of public opinion. Congress both led opinion and followed it, bringing about change that was swifter and less predictable than in normal periods of interest group politics.},

Our analysis of the cross-disease and cross-temporal variation in media attention suggests that who suffers from a disease as well as how many suffer are critical factors in explaining why some diseases get more attention than others. In particular, our data reveal that both the print and the broadcast media tend to be much less attentive to diseases that disproportionately burden blacks relative to whites. We also find a positive link between the size of organizational communities that take an interest in disease and media attention, though this finding depends on the characteristics of those communities. Finally, this study also reveals the limitations of relying on single-disease case studies - and particularly HIV/AIDS - to understand how and why disease captures public attention. Many previous inferences about media attention that have been drawn from the case of AIDS are not reflective of the attention allocated to other diseases.},

Using a data set consisting of 65 Court decisions that reversed all or pan of some federal statute(s), we test our hypotheses using a probit model to predict when the Congress will take counteraction. We find that the electoral considerations of public opinion and interest group pressure are likely to lead to a congressional response, while the institutional considerations of court unanimity and the age of the legislation struck down are also important.

In this setting, emotional reactions appear to be the link between repression and backlash mobilization.

	abstract = {The current study presents the Men's Project, a sexual assault prevention program that targets college men. The Men's Project integrates social norms, empathy, and bystander education programs into one program for college men. Male student leaders were recruited to participate in the 11-week program for 2 hours each week. The beginning of the program introduces men to issues of gender socialization, male privilege, and sexuality, followed by a few weeks exploring the breadth and depth of sexual violence, including its emotional and psychological impacts on survivors. Finally, participants learn about bystander intervention at individual and institutional levels. Participants completed a survey before and after participation in the Men's Project. Results demonstrate that from baseline to posttest, participants reported reductions in sexism, rape myth acceptance, and gender-biased language use in addition to increases in collective action willingness, feminist activism, and bystander efficacy. Discussion centers on men's role in ending sexual violence and the need for more prevention programs targeting men. The present article demonstrates the utility of the Men's Project in engaging men to work toward ending sexual violence.},

	abstract = {While research on social movement outcomes has increased significantly, less is known about how the causal determinants of movement success might vary over time. Quantitative historical methods, such as time series and event history analysis, take time-varying factors into account, but these methods also assume that the statistical relationships found are stable over time. This may not always be true. Instead, changing historical contexts may lead to changes in the causal determinants of movement outcomes, so a movement tactic such as legal mobilization is important in some years, but not in others. Using a series of "moving" event histories, this article investigates whether there have been variations over time in the causal determinants of sodomy law decriminalization, a long-term goal of the gay and lesbian movement, between 1961 and 1998. Results indicate that that the causes of decriminalization do vary across time. More specifically, the shift from legislative repeal to judicial invalidation as the primary mechanism of decriminalization, and changes in the primary advocates of reform from legal experts to movement activists significantly changed the factors contributing to sodomy law decriminalization over time.},

We argue that the nature of reporting bias depends on how news organizations navigate the political context in which they are based. Where government pressure on the media is limited - in democratic regimes - the scope of reporting should reflect conventional media preferences toward novel, large-scale, dramatic developments that challenge the conventional wisdom and highlight the unsustainability of the status quo. Where political constraints on reporting are more onerous - in non-democratic regimes - the more conservative preferences of the state will drive the scope of coverage, emphasizing the legitimacy and inevitability of the prevailing order. We test these propositions using new data on protest and political violence during the 2011 Libyan uprising and daily newspaper coverage of the Arab Spring from 113 countries. We uncover evidence of a status-quo media bias in non-democratic states, and a revisionist bias in democratic states. Media coverage in non-democracies underreported protests and nonviolent collective action by regime opponents, largely ignored government atrocities, and overreported those caused by rebels. We find the opposite patterns in democratic states.},

	abstract = {China has undergone a media revolution that has transformed the domestic context for making foreign policy as well as domestic policy. The commercialization of the mass media has changed the way leaders and publics interact in the process of making foreign policy. As they compete with one another, the new media naturally try to appeal to the tastes of their potential audiences. Editors make choices about which stories to cover based on their judgments about which ones will resonate best with audiences. In China today, that means a lot of stories about Japan, Taiwan, and the United States, the topics that are the objects of Chinese popular nationalism. The publicity given these topics makes them domestic political issues because they are potential focal points for elite disagreement and mass collective action, and thereby constrains the way China's leaders and diplomats deal with them. Even relatively minor events involving China's relations with Japan, Taiwan, or the United States become big news, and therefore relations with these three governments must be carefully handled by the politicians in the Communist Party Politburo Standing Committee. Because of the Internet, it is impossible for Party censors to screen out news from Japan, Taiwan or the United States that might upset the public. Common knowledge of such news forces officials to react to every slight, no matter how small. Foreign policy makers feel especially constrained by nationalist public opinion when it comes to its diplomacy with Japan. Media marketization and the Internet have helped make Japan China's most emotionally charged international relationship.},

At the same time, this relationship is expected to be particularly strong when online alternative media use is coupled with specific types of movement experiences. Analysis of a representative survey (N = 1012) in Hong Kong shows that both online alternative media use and participation in the Umbrella Movement in 2014 related positively to the attitude toward violent protests and toward Hong Kong independence, and the relationship between online alternative media use and radical views was particularly strong among the Umbrella Movement participants.

	abstract = {The increase in frequency and extent of fires in Portugal has favoured the approval of a new legal frame for forest management, the Forest Intervention Zone (FIZ). Under this frame, a large contiguous surface involving numerous owners is subject to a single management plan, providing an opportunity for cooperation. Since 2005, 161 zones have been created but only half of them have had their management plan approved and very few are nearing its implementation. Cooperation amongst private forest owners has usually been explained at the owner level. In an approach at the local level we examine local constraints and key-factors for cooperative landscape management. Building on the theory of collective action, a typology of FIZ/territories is established by Cluster Analysis using a group of ecological and socioeconomic variables expressing the characteristics of natural resources, owners' group, institutional arrangements, and external environment of FIZs. Three clusters are identified. Where FIZs are smaller and biophysical resources impose greater wildfire susceptibility, the transaction costs for collective management are highest due to more numerous, aged, and dispersed owners and the absence of a land registry. Conversely, larger FIZs have fewer owners, more powerful management bodies, and higher public financial incentives, leading to greater performance rate. Nonetheless, since their resources are less fire-prone, and private profitability is higher, public support for collective action has a lower social return. Addressing the heterogeneity of local systems of ecological and socioeconomic constraints is therefore a challenge faced by public policy makers seeking to mitigate wildfire risk.

	abstract = {Many contested issues in the American public and political spheres are rooted in fundamentally differing views of the scope, causes, and consequences of social problems. This is certainly true for two major interrelated social problems with racial implications: crime and labor market inequalities. In the era since the civil rights movement made the open expression of racial bias less socially acceptable, however, public and political discussions of social problems with racial implications are often framed in purportedly race-neutral ways (Bonilla-Silva 2010; Schuman et al. 1997). Drawing on group position (Blumer 1958) and collective action framing (Benford and Snow 2000) perspectives and employing the 2008-2009 ANES Panel Study, the present work suggests an enduring influence of racial bias on the ways people understand these major social problems. In contrast to earlier eras, however, much of the contemporary role of racial bias is hidden. The current work employs an implicit measure of racial bias that is resistant to a social desirability bias (Payne et al. 2005) to reveal a more complete picture of the influence of racial bias on the way people perceive social problems-even among those who explicitly deny possessing such biases. Specifically, this work reveals roles for both explicit and implicit racial bias in the way non-Hispanic whites identify the severity of problems, attribute blame for problems, and are motivated to concern around particular issues.},

We contend that these two distinct efficacy judgments are tied to community integration and media use, yet have very different consequences for political participation. Specifically, we predict that when actual citizen efficacy falls to meet expectations, people will tend to favor more individual forms of political participation over collective efforts. Using data from a random digit dialing community survey, this research finds: (i) that evaluations of desired citizen efficacy are conceptually different from evaluations of actual citizen efficacy; (2) that demographics, community integration, and mass media use significantly predict both types of efficacy-but do so differently; and (3) that the efficacy gap positively predicts individual forms of political participation and negatively predicts collective action.},

We show that public views about immigration are responsive to changes in immigration levels and differences between migrant groups, and that policy-makers are sensitive to these changes. Policy-makers look to respond to the public mood on migration, but face growing constraints in doing so. The interaction of public opinion, policy and constraint has produced three distinct policy regimes. In the first, from 1982 to 1997, policy-makers faced few constraints, immigration was tightly controlled and the public were unconcerned about the issue. In the second, from 1997 to 2004, migration policy was selectively liberalised in response to external and interest group pressures, producing increasing inflows and growing public demands for restriction. In the third, from 2004 to the time of writing, public demand for restriction is strong but policy-makers face significant constraints in responding. In all periods, policy-makers seek to focus restriction on the migrant streams most opposed by the public, but as they have lost discretionary power over the issue they have been forced to take action against more economically valuable and socially accepted migrant streams. The growing constraints on policy-makers have therefore sharpened the trade-off between the responsive' government of meeting public demands for immigrations restriction and the responsible' government goal of providing for the needs of a flexible, globally integrated economy.},

Integrated models are an attractive choice for explaining multifaceted decisions, particularly when simpler, existing theories have an uneven or only partial ability to explain conflict behavior. To illustrate these points, this study assesses the behavior of key NATO members during the 1999 intervention in Kosovo. I compare the behavior of France, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and the U.S. with the expectations of theories of collective action, balance of threat neorealism, public opinion, and government institutional structures. As an alternative, I introduce a simple, integrated, decision-making model that incorporates the core concepts from the other explanations in a staged, conditional manner. The integrated model does a better job of explaining state behavior in Kosovo than do existing theories. The integrated model also is applicable to other conflicts. The results of this study, and the potential of integrated models, have implications for our thinking about foreign policy analysis, for behavior during military interventions and the fight against terrorism, and for future U.S. leadership of alliance and coalition war efforts.},

Generally, it seems that reactions to the coup were not based on strictly rational calculations and that basic commitments to the collective good of democracy motivated resistance. My general conclusion is that a mass culture has emerged in Russia that nurtures democracy. The 1991 coup demonstrates that for many people in the former Soviet states there is little alternative to democratic politics.},

This null relationship has puzzled scholars of abortion attitudes. In an attempt to shed light on this relationship, this paper argues that gender differences in religiosity help explain the lack of a gender difference in abortion attitudes, with religiosity acting as a suppressor variable for the theoretically expected relationship between gender and support for legal abortion. Data from the 2012 General Social Survey support the hypothesis that the expected gender difference in support for legal abortion emerges when religiosity is controlled in multivariate analysis. This result indicates that religiosity is indeed suppressing women's greater support for legal abortion, as anticipated by the interest-group perspective. Final remarks outline directions for future research suggested by the analysis.},

We argue that the abilities of local Occupy movements to cope with challenges and magnify their resonance in the public sphere largely depended on how they were connected to local activist networks. We provide a political geography of Occupy and show how local networks in Amsterdam and Los Angeles shaped the global movement. Occupy activists were able to connect to some of the more prominent elements of Los Angeles' local activist networks and effectively formulated claims, but Occupy activists in Amsterdam were isolated and lost public support. The aims of the essay are twofold: first, to explain these divergent outcomes and second, to assess the effects of these outcomes in shaping the sustainability of Occupy struggles in these cities over the medium term.},

Critical events are contextually dramatic happenings, such as economic depressions, environmental disasters, intense physical confrontations, strategic initiatives by a social movement organization, or new public policies. A critical event focuses public attention, which is itself a scarce resource in the claims-making process. It invites the collective definition or redefinition of a social problem when movement activists, media operatives, and others compete over the meaning assigned to the issues evoked. A redefining critical event occurs when the perception of reality surrounding movement issues shifts markedly among elites and mass publics. In a case in Nashville, TN, for example, a tax-increase referendum became a redefining event when conservative movement operatives successfully shifted ”the problem” of the schools from issues of distributive justice to issues of efficient production. The public then substantially lowered its assessment of the public schools in a short period of time, even though performance indicators for the schools seemed not to warrant this diminution in public esteem.},

Twitter followers of the imprisoned Saudis engaged in more online dissent, including criticizing the ruling family and calling for regime change.

However, the idea that citizen voice through social media can give rise, under given conditions, to a specific digital force combining properties of social movements and public opinion has received less attention. We fill this gap by analysing the digital discussion around the Twitter hashtag \#RefugeesWelcome as a case of digital movement of opinion' (DMO). When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, an extraordinary wave of empathy characterized the publics' reactions in key European hosting countries, especially as a result of viral images portraying refugee children as the main victims. Using a triangulation of network, content and metadata analysis, we find that this DMO was driven primarily by social media elites whose tweets were then echoed by masses of isolated users. We then test the post-DMO status of the hashtag-sphere after a potentially antithetical shock such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, which polarized the network public. Overall, we argue that the concept of DMO provides a heuristically useful tool for future research on new forms of digital citizen participation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.06.019},
	abstract = {Past research by one of the authors of this paper has identified four key institutional challenges that community-driven initiatives to improve sanitation in deprived urban settlements face: the collective action challenge of improving community sanitation; the coproduction challenge of working with formal service providers to dispose of the sanitary waste safely; the affordability challenge of reconciling the affordable with what is acceptable to both users and local authorities; and the tenure challenge of preventing housing insecurity from undermining residents' willingness to commit to sanitary improvement. In this article we examine how two well-documented, relatively successful and longstanding initiatives, the Orangi Pilot Project and an Alliance of Indian partners, met these challenges. They were met through social innovation, but also through the choice and development of sanitation technologies (simplified sewers for OPP and community toilet blocks for the Indian Alliance) that provided traction for the social innovations. We also explore more recent efforts by civil society partnerships in four African cities, demonstrating some of the difficulties they have faced in trying to overcome these challenges. No equivalent models have emerged, though there has been considerable progress against particular challenges in particular places. These findings confirm the importance of the challenges, and indicate that these are not just challenges for social organization, but also for technology design and choice. For example, the problem with household pit latrines is not that they cannot physically be improved to sufficiently, but that they are not well-suited to the social, economic and political challenges of sanitary improvement at scale. The findings also indicate that a low economic status and a tendency to treat sanitation as a private good not suitable for public support also makes the sanitation challenges difficult to overcome.

Results from a sample of sexual minority (n = 367) and heterosexual (n = 1,707) college students suggest that the majority of students from both sexual orientation groups are willing to sign a petition for LGBT rights. Although the impact of framing variables, such as transphobia and liberal identity, were most influential among both groups, the relevance of some framing antecedents (i.e., heterosexist attitudes and the disclosure of sexual identities) was specific to each sexuality. Before the inclusion of framing factors, knowing LGBT peers and observing heterosexist discrimination inspired greater activism among both sexuality groups as did being female and a graduate student; however, the significance of religious factors were only important among heterosexual students.

	abstract = {This study aims at better understanding how, and to what extent, perceptions of a policy instrument's distributional effects impact on policy support, focusing on the case of CO2 taxes on petrol in Sweden. Through a large-scale (N = 5000) randomized survey experiment with a 2 x 3 factorial design, the extent to which perceptions of fairness determine attitudes to a suggested increase of the Swedish CO2 tax is explored. Furthermore, the study considers whether these effects change with the level of the suggested tax increase, as well as whether negative sentiments can be alleviated by combining it with a compensatory measure in the shape of a simultaneous income tax cut financed by the revenues from the tax increase. The results show that a higher tax increase is both viewed as more unfair and enjoys weaker support. Furthermore, compensatory measures can be a powerful policy design tool to increase perceptions of the policy as fair, but the effect of compensation on policy support is conditioned by the individual's left-right ideological position. Whereas people self-identifying to the right react favourably to compensatory measures, people self-identifying to the left become less supportive of a tax increase when combined with a simultaneous cut in income taxes. Key policy insights Perceptions of fairness are highly important for explaining public support for climate policy tools, specifically CO2 taxes. Compensatory measures can be a powerful policy design tool to increase perceptions of the policy as less unfair. However, the effect of compensatory measures on policy support is conditioned by ideological position, and only successful among people to the ideological right. In contexts dominated by right-wing ideals, a combination of a tax and a compensatory scheme may be a successful route forward towards increased climate policy support. In left-oriented contexts the results imply that a CO2 tax without compensation seems more likely to increase support.},

The results show that hostile media perceptions have a direct association with climate activism that is conditioned by political ideology: Among liberals, hostile media perceptions promote activism, whereas among conservatives, they decrease activism. Hostile media perceptions also have a negative, indirect relationship with activism that is mediated through external political efficacy; however, this relationship is conditioned by both ideology and internal political efficacy.

The issues of what role the public plays in regulatory processes, and how health policy officials orient to public opinion, matter especially in the US context, where public commentary is a requisite component of federal rule-making. This paper examines written commentary as one specific, institutionalized form of public participation. To understand the relationship between scientific evidence and public commentary in public health regulation, we examine a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation; proposed in 1995, to restrict the promotion and sale of tobacco products to minors. We use recent work on collective action frames to analyse how the FDA framed the proposed regulation as a rational, science-based policy; the discursive practices employed in the public commentary either to embrace or to contest the FDA's framing and how the agency presented the final version of its rule as responsive, to. that public commentary. Our content analyses reveal a significant disparity between the FDA's emphasis on scientific evidence and the commentators' emphases on political and ideological frames, which we analyse in terms of counter-framing, An orientation to the dynamics of framing and counter-framing contributes to an understanding of the relationship between scientific evidence and public commentary in the formulation of controversial health policy regulations.},

In these threat situations, the justices will be most likely to shift their final votes on the merits in a manner congruent with the preferences of Congress. Based on our logit analysis of data on all orally argued statutory cases from 1963 to 1995, we find mixed support for our hypotheses and conclude that there are limited conditions under which congressional preferences may influence a justice's vote.},

We find considerable differences but also some interdependencies across actor types in the salience that they attach to specific policies. Based on these findings, we suggest a research agenda that investigates different actor types' salience attributions synchronically and dynamically.

	abstract = {This study investigates how the nature of grievances can provide advantages or disadvantages to social movements. I use an experimental design to test the effects of loss aversion and omission bias on people's reactions toward grievances and the campaigns that seek to address them. The results indicate that grievances involving a loss are perceived as more immoral, unjust, and important than grievances involving a gain. Loss-based grievances also generate stronger emotions, increase willingness to engage in activism, and produce perceptions of greater public support. Similarly, grievances resulting from a commission (action), as compared to an omission (inaction), are seen as more immoral, unjust, and important. Commission-based grievances direct attribution of blame toward perpetrators, evoke higher levels of emotions, and increase willingness to participate in campaigns. These findings provide support for the idea that not all grievances are created equal in their ability to appeal to and potentially mobilize the public.},

Evidence suggests that people are more tolerant of opposing groups after being exposed to alternative points of view, yet it is unclear how source credibility and previous exposure to the source moderates this effect. Using experimental survey data from a sample of evangelical Protestant PAC donors, I manipulate Christian Right activists' exposure to dissonant messages on immigration reform and capital punishment and vary the source of these messages. I find that when the opposing viewpoints are attributed to a religious leader generally found outside the Christian Right social movement (a mainline Protestant), evangelicals are less tolerant than when attributed to a religious leader sometimes found within the movement (a Catholic). Moreover, I find the amount of contact with the respective religious group moderates source effects. In this way, the study reveals how social networks may moderate the effect of elite discourse on public opinion.},

The substantive issue involves the public's deep ambivalence toward government reforms: Americans are simultaneously supportive of significant reform and uneasy about expanding government involvement. The critical question is what, if any, impact this public ambivalence will have on policy deliberations. Answering this question requires an analysis of the role of public opinion in policy-making. Investigation of historic as well as contemporary health reform suggests that the impact of public opinion varies, depending on the character of both public opinion and the policy issue. The public's preferences are not especially influential when they are characterized by uncertainty or when an issue is not salient, but strong and sustained sentiment can affect agenda setting, interest group leverage over government officials, and policymakers' formulation of detailed administrative arrangements.},

We adapt social psychological measures to assess whether such an identity does indeed exist, examine the factors that predict whether individuals hold the identity, and assess whether the identity predicts individuals' political attitudes and participation. Methods We analyze two distinct survey data sets using various statistical techniques: (1) an original Mechanical Turk survey and (2) a survey of gun owners conducted by the Pew Research Center. Results Gun owner identity is an individual characteristic that can be meaningfully measured. Moreover, gun owner identity is predicted by contact with the National Rifle Association and participation in gun-related social activities, among other factors. Further, this identity strongly predicts firearm-related policy attitudes, the importance individuals place upon these issues, and their propensity to act in opposition to gun regulations, all independent of gun ownership. Conclusions Our results suggest that nuanced measurement of gun owner identity can provide a richer understanding of gun policy attitudes, identity politics, and interest group influence. In so doing, they help explain gun rights supporters' unusual dedication and, by extension, the NRA's success in the realm of gun policy.},

	abstract = {In 2012, a group of young activists changed the landscape of the Chinese feminist movement. These activists placed women's rights in the mainstream public discourse by drawing the media's attention to their "performance art". This study compares the intergenerational differences between China's first generation of women's NGOs, which were mostly founded or flourished in the wake of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, and a new generation that burst on the scene in 2012. The study argues that their main differences lie in their mobilization models and their ability to access key political resources, both of which were heavily influenced, and even decided, by their relationship with the state. Moreover, the change in the relationship between the state and feminist movements is reflected in the differences in the relationship with the media of the two generations of feminist movements. Because of the differences in their organizational models, resource conditions, and status, the two generations of feminists adopted different media strategies in their promotion of women's rights. Using the "performance art" of the " Occupy Men's Toilet" campaign as an example, we examine the media strategies employed by young feminists and illustrate how they legitimated the movements, aroused public attention, imposed pressure from the outside, and finally gained policy responses from the government. The study proposes the tripartite relationship between the state, media, and the two generations of the women's movement in China, and concludes that the relationship between media and the women's movements examined here was influenced and even decided by their respective relationships with the state.},

Accordingly, this study draws on national survey data to examine the extent to which racial attitudes and conservative ideology are associated with self-declared membership in the TPM while controlling for contextual factors that have proven influential in other rightist movement research. Key findings reveal that aside from conservative political ideology, racial resentment is indeed among the strongest predictors of TPM membership. Supplemental analyses explore the extent to which conservatives differ from TPM members. The results show that very conservative individuals and TPM members evince similar attitudes. The findings are discussed in terms of contemporary race relations and the implications for future social movement research. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Second, direct democracy opens new policy areas for representation, which may increase the scope and level of political conflict and draw in new participants. Third, by providing more opportunities for involvement in policymaking, direct democracy may create a more engaged citizenry, spurring the joining of groups. We utilize data from the pooled General Social Survey merged with state-level measures of the presence and use of the initiative process.

	abstract = {The eighth International Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG) meeting was held in Chicago, IL, United States, in 19-22 October 2006 to discuss mesothelioma -the cancer often linked to asbestos exposure. It is a very aggressive malignancy with a median survival of less than 1 year from diagnosis. Millions of people have been exposed worldwide to asbestos, especially during the second half of the twentieth century when asbestos use increased significantly. The tons of asbestos utilized in the past remain a health hazard for current and future generations because asbestos is difficult to be disposed off. This makes asbestos and mesothelioma research a public health issue in addition to a medical problem. Moreover, the very high costs of asbestos litigation have a signi. cant impact on the whole economy. In the United States, up until 2001, defendant companies had paid 54 billion dollars in claims and estimated future liabilities ranged from 145 to 210 billion. Therefore, asbestos research is of great interest to a large audience that includes patients, millions of asbestos-exposed individuals, scientists, physicians, public health officials, politicians, unions of asbestos workers, lawyers and the public at large. During the past few years, there has been signi. cant progress in understanding the process of mineral fiber carcinogenesis and mesothelioma pathogenesis. With improved understanding of the pathogenesis of mesothelioma, new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic options are being developed. A total of 247 papers were presented at the IMIG: the abstracts of these presentations were published in Lung Cancer, Supplement 1, October 2006. Here, experts in different disciplines critically review some of the most exciting presentations of the IMIG meeting. The result is a comprehensive review of the research field of asbestos carcinogenesis and mesothelioma, and of the progress that has been made in recent years in both basic and clinical sciences.},

	abstract = {In the spring of 2014, some anti-Maidan protestors in southeast Ukraine, in alliance with activists from Russia, agitated for the creation of a large separatist entity on Ukrainian territory. These efforts sought to revive a historic region called Novorossiya ("New Russia") on the northern shores of the Black Sea that was created by Russian imperial colonizers. In public remarks, Vladimir Putin cited Novorossiya as a historic and contemporary home of a two-part interest group, ethnic Russian and Russian-speaking Ukrainians, supposedly under threat in Ukraine. Anti-Maidan agitation in Ukraine gave way to outright secession in April 2014, as armed rebel groups established the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhans'k People's Republic on parts of the eponymous Ukrainian oblasts. Rebel leaders aspired to create a renewed Novorossiya that incorporated all of eastern and southern Ukraine from Kharkiv to Odesa oblasts. To examine the level of support for this secessionist imaginary in the targeted oblasts, our large scientific poll in December 2014 revealed the Novorossiya project had minority support, between 20 and 25\% of the population. About half of the sample believed that the concept of Novorossiya was a " historical myth" and that its resuscitation and promotion was the result of " Russian political technologies." Analysis of the responses by socio-demographic categories indicated that for ethnic Russians, residents of the oblasts of Kharkiv and Odesa, for older and poorer residents, and especially for those who retain a nostalgic positive opinion about the Soviet Union, the motivations and aims of the Novorossiya project had significant support.},

Drawing on quantitative data, archival work, and elite interviews, we review empirical support for this model and find that the evidence for its claims is weak relative to the theory's pervasive influence. We find, first, that the strongest collective action claims appear empirically unsubstantiated in many important climate politics cases. Second, collective action claims-whether in their strongest or in more nuanced versions-appear observationally equivalent to alternative theories focused on distributive conflict within countries. We argue that extant patterns of climate policy making can be explained without invoking free-riding. Governments implement climate policies regardless of what other countries do, and they do so whether a climate treaty dealing with free-riding has been in place or not. Without an empirically grounded model for global climate policy making, institutional and political responses to climate change may ineffectively target the wrong policy-making dilemma. We urge scholars to redouble their efforts to analyze the empirical linkages between domestic and international factors shaping climate policy making in an effort to empirically ground theories of global climate politics.

Here we test the claim that extreme protest actions-protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both- typically reduce support for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were preregistered. participants indicated less support for social movements that used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in 5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led participants to support the movement's central cause less, and these effects were largely independent of individuals' prior ideology or views on the issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social identification with the movement. In Studies 4-6, serial mediation analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest actions to be immoral, reducing observers' emotional connection to the movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist's dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.},

While the European Union has sent billions of taxpayers' money to over indebted euro countries in an attempt to avoid an economic collapse, these transfers have encountered fierce resistance among both donor and recipient constituents. However, we know surprisingly little about why citizens support or oppose redistribution within the EU. This paper suggests that domestic levels of corruption and institutional quality may be one of the most important explanations for the great variation in public support for financial assistance, bailouts and aid. Using recent European Elections Survey data merged with data on regional level quality of government, we show that the effects of institutional quality are consistently stronger than macro-economic factors, including economic development, inequality or levels of public debt. We find strong evidence that citizens in low corrupt contexts are more likely to support financial assistance to fellow member states. The results have implications for future challenges in securing public support for EU economic integration as well as for our understanding of how and why corruption undermines society's collective action capacity.},

These "sociopolitical issues" are vastly different from corporate social responsibility and corporate political activities, as they are divisive, emotionally charged, and institutionally contested social issues. In this article, we explore sociopolitical issues and develop a distinct model that relies on multiple theoretical perspectives agency theory and a push-versus-pull perspective of stakeholder theory to provide complementary or at times competing explanations for firm involvement in such controversial issues.

The use of smartphone applications (apps) related to health (mHealth) is increasing and, while there is potential for apps to be used as a self-managed balance intervention, many healthcare providers are concerned about the content and credibility of mHealth apps overall. Purpose: This study evaluates the quality of balance promoting apps and identifies strengths and areas of concern to assist healthcare providers in recommending these resources. Materials and methods: Balance apps for the general public, offered on the iPhone Operating System (iOS) and Android platforms, were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Results: Five iOS apps met the inclusion criteria. The mean scores for each of the domains in MARS were: Engagement (3.32), Information (3.7), Functionality (3.8), and Esthetics (3.8). Overall, one app (UStabilize) received a rating of 4.43 in MARS five-point scale, which was considered "good". Other apps in the review demonstrated acceptable quality. Conclusions: The reviewed balance apps targeted to improve or maintain physical balance were of acceptable quality. Apps address many current issues older adults have to accessing rehabilitation services and, as such, may be particularly useful for this group. Future research should focus on assessing and comparing app efficacy. Development of balance apps for the Android platform is also necessary.},

Not only have they eased centralized processes of information sharing between social movement entrepreneurs and social movement publics, they have also bolstered the crowdsourced management of public discussion around social contention.

By investigating Twitter streams with reference to the Italian chapter of the 15 October 2011 polycentric protest for global change, this study specifically addresses the use of this medium in the aftermath of protest events of high impact for the general public. The quantitative analysis of longitudinal progression, networking mechanisms and processes of meaning construction in over 8000 tweets shows that Twitter does bolster public reasoning around social contention. It does so as a news medium rather than a conversational platform, primarily providing a space to share information alternative to that available in mainstream media coverage.

While in May the largest percentage of respondents to date supported decriminalizing such activity, that percentage dropped eleven points two months later. Similar declines in support were evident in the same period over a range of gay and lesbian rights claims. The ruling in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) decriminalizing homosexual sex is the obvious intervening event. To explain this pattern, coding of print and televised news coverage of the ruling throughout 2003 was undertaken. Coverage was not overtly negative in terms of antigay rhetoric or hostility toward the judiciary; rather, the dominant media frame focused on the implications of Lawrence for an entirely separate rights issue: marriage equality. This article examines the dynamic of frame spillover, or the idea that media focus on a distinct and not widely supported rights claim in a multifaceted rights agenda might depress support across the entire rights agenda. The findings call for further research, and they have implications for scholarship on public opinion, social movement framing, and ideational development and policy debate as studied within the broader field of American political development.},

	abstract = {The design of efficient public policies that aim to improve the provision of ecosystem services faces the problem that many ecosystem services are only apparent at spatial levels beyond the level at which they are managed. This makes it impossible to measure the contribution of individual resource managers to the provision of these services, as is the case in landscapes managed by private landowners such as farmers. As a consequence, the magnitude of the public support associated with the implementation of a policy cannot be specified down to the level of the individual manager/land owner. In this situation, institutional arrangements among resource managers are needed to determine how the public support defined at the higher level can be fairly distributed. This paper proposes a financial compensation arrangement among resource managers in a landscape, based on the Kaldor-Hicks criterion leading to a Pareto-optimal improvement, and explores the institutional requirements for the effective implementation of this arrangement. The proposed arrangement is illustrated with a case study in a woodland landscape in The Netherlands. The results show that private benefits among farms differed considerably due to biophysical, ecological and geographic differences among the farms. The financial compensation arrangement could contribute to improved equity among natural resource managers, which has been proposed as a key requirement for implementation of effective governance of environmental changes. The discussion addresses the institutional requirements of the proposed arrangement for governance structures that effectively deal with biophysical and socio-economic scale mismatches in sustainable use of natural resources.

	abstract = {While vaccine-critical activism has been widely documented and discussed, comparatively little has been said about the concerted response of pro-vaccine activists defending the majority view. This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US). It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement - oppositional counter-activities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US. The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes 'skeptics' against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups. In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study - of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination - can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups.},

Group dynamics theories suggest that how individuals define their group boundaries moderates the impact of immigration on support for the welfare state. Immigrant presence should have the strongest effects for those with exclusive national group boundaries; weaker for those with conditionally inclusive boundaries based on reciprocity; and weakest or non-existent for those with inclusive group boundaries. Group boundaries should interact with material self-interest, leading individuals with less material security who are more likely to face social risks to be more supportive of the welfare state. Using data from the 4th European Social Survey linked to regional and national data, we find that group boundary salience plays a large moderating role in the relationship between immigration and native support for the welfare state, and that this role is intricately linked to material self-interest. Group dynamics should therefore be viewed in conjunction with existing structural welfare state theories as opposed to an alternative or isolated mechanism.},

This essay presents the first systematic study of public opinion about the environment in Kyrgyzstan. It includes results from a 2009 nationwide survey, over 100 expert and elite interviews, and newspaper content analysis. Furthermore, it spatially analyzes these results to identify geographical variation in public perception and political event occurrence patterns. Protest engagement is a complex process determined by the interaction of several factors, and is not explained solely by affluence, rationality, or grievances. Eco-mobilization - collective political action about the environment - represents a class of protest events that offers a different view into mass discontent in the former Soviet Union and neo-patrimonial societies. The study finds that these political actions about the environment are not necessarily elite driven; there is a basic foundation of national concern and salience of these issues, and demonstrated environmental beliefs do help to explain protest behavior.},

Moreover the particular effect is mediated by the type of venue in which the outcome takes place: formal institutions produce different rates of increase and decline than informal ones.

One form such grievances may take is that of "flawed executions"-executions in which public sensibilities are offended by a breakdown in routine procedures of convicting murderers and putting them to death. This paper discusses four ways in which executions may be flawed executions may be technically botched, convicts may not play their assigned roles, the prescribed solemnity of the death chamber may be compromised, and finally, irregularities in conviction and sentencing may come to light when abolitionist organizations and the press make issues of these flaws, they become factors in death penalty politics. An analysis of newspaper coverage suggests that flawed convictions, in which possibly innocent persons either suffer or narrowly escape execution, are especially potent threats to public support for capital punishment. The paper concludes by stressing the centrality of social movement organizations and the media in transforming underpublicized or affect-neutral events into suddenly realized grievances.},

The structural equation modeling results suggest that one's connections with others, including socializing with relatives and friends as well as general social networking, are significantly and positively related to various dimensions of environmental concern. Greater trust is positively related to one's willingness to make sacrifices for the benefit of the environment but is also negatively related to perceived dangerousness of pollution. Our findings highlight the value of social capital in promoting environmental concern. We discuss these findings in the context of existing literature, and propose policy implications and suggest directions for future research.},

The Spanish DPS had been a key resource for subaltern publics since the 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid, Spain, when citizens, using their mobile phones and the Net, claimed that the bombings were a consequence of the country's involvement in the Iraq War. That early digitally organized mobilization meant the collapse of the political-communication system. Later, the 15-M in 2011 expressed a widespread new public opinion consensus.

In large part, this can be attributed to sceptical public opinion. The precise role played by public opinion in constraining the political feasibility of pension reform is, however, unclear. The purpose of this paper is to distil the ways in which public attitudes influence pension reform. This is done through examining survey data from Greece, where progress with the implementation of pension reform has been particularly modest. Political opposition to pension reform appears to be rooted in a general lack of public appreciation of the case for reform combined with the desire to protect interest group privileges, Public ignorance and insecurity breed attitudes not conducive to reform. Public attitudes do not simply act as a given constraint on reform but are a product of the structure of the pension system and the reform process itself. In this path-dependent process, implementation of a reform agenda of rationalisation is more difficult from the starting point of a severely fragmented and distorted system.},

A Swedish survey experiment shows that the effect of ideology varies greatly depending on how individuals think about the environment. Specifically, it demonstrates that if environmental support is contrasted with economic growth, then the effect of ideology is stronger as opposed to when environmental support is not juxtaposed with economic growth. Furthermore, among people who strongly perceive the environment as a left-right issue, there is a larger divide between left and right.},

	abstract = {Background: Tobacco industry funding was instrumental in creating and financing the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 as an organisation that relied upon extensive media outreach to build opposition to excise taxes as a regressive form of taxation. By obscuring its own role in this effort, the tobacco industry undermined the public's reasonable expectations for transparency in the policy-making process. Aim: To examine the formation and activities of the Consumer Tax Alliance as a "hybrid” form of interest group in order to provide tobacco control and public health advocates with a better understanding of unanticipated tobacco industry coalitions and facilitate appropriate countermeasures. Methods: Document searches through the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and through Tobacco Documents Online and review of background literature. Results: The Tobacco Institute actively sought liberal allies beginning in the mid-1980s in seeking to build public opposition to cigarette excise tax increases by promoting them as a regressive form of taxation. The creation of the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 was expressly intended to turn labour and middle-class opinion against prospective excise tax increases in federal budget deficit negotiations, without divulging the tobacco industry's role in its formation. Conclusion: It is important to understand the dynamic by which trusted organisations can be induced to alter their agendas in response to funding sources. Advocates need to understand this form of interest group behaviour so that they are better able to negotiate the policy arena by diagnosing and exposing this influence where it occurs and, by doing so, be better prepared to take appropriate countermeasures.},

While previous work has portrayed authoritarian regimes as characterized by mass apathy and political demobilization, we show that this is only partially true today. We argue that autocrats mobilize their supporters selectively as a strategic response to political threats. Rallies increase collective action costs for rivaling elites, opposition movements, and bystanders because they signal regime strength (deterrence) and curb mobilization efforts against the regime (repression). Nevertheless, the mobilization of supporters is costly, as autocrats have only imperfect information about current levels of support, rallies require organizational capacity and clashes between supporters and opponents can get out of control. Drawing on the first global data set with information about pro-government rally events in all authoritarian regimes from 2003 to 2015, our quantitative analysis reveals systematic patterns in the occurrence of rallies in line with our theoretical framework. We find systematic increases in pro-government mobilization during episodes of large domestic and regional opposition mobilization, high coup risk, and prior to elections.},

Here we investigate how trust in various actors (i.e., citizens in general, business actors, and political institutions) affects attitudes to different kinds of state intervention (i.e., push vs. pull instruments). We hypothesize that distrust, through a willingness to punish, generates demand for push policies, while trust, through a willingness to reward, generates demand for pull policies. Using survey responses from approximately 1800 Swedish college students, different trust measures were found to have different links to attitudes to state intervention: trust in public administration is a stable predictor of EPI support, whereas distrust in business actors generates stronger support for punishing instruments. We also found that preferences for push policies are associated with a willingness to punish, whereas preferences for pull policies are associated with a willingness to reward. We conclude that different trust measures should not be conflated when discussing whether trust explains attitudes to state environmental intervention.},

Moreover, the herding level of the highest idiosyncratic volatility quintile portfolio is twice that of the lowest quintile portfolio which we consider evidence of intentional herding. This result is consistent with those of previous studies, which report that retail investors prefer and overweigh lottery-type stocks.

Annual surveys were sent to 1\% of the population (similar to 2500 individuals) during the period 2002-2004. The addressees were also asked if they wanted to participate in public meetings with the healthcare politicians. This study investigates what happened to the preferences and attitudes of the interest group when the participants were not only offered an opportunity to enter into a dialogue with their peers and representatives, but also received information on prioritisation matters. After the intervention, which consisted of two public meetings with politicians and five information booklets on prioritisation issues. the study group was asked to participate in a second survey. At the follow-up, 20\% fewer thought that one should always have a right to public healthcare, even if troubles were trivial. Eighty four percent in the study group thought that the general public should participate in prioritisation discussions while only 64\% in the control group agreed to this. Eighty two percent of the study group marked the dialogue project "good" or "very good". The results indicate an increased acceptance for reallocations, a strengthened will to participate and more confidence in the politicians and their work. The study is descriptive and designed to make long-term follow-ups possible. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The first question asked is: who supports programmes targeted at the different groups? The second question concerns whether the support varies when different techniques are used regarding measuring support for welfare state programmes - those programmes that are recommendable, those people want to spend their tax money on and the programmes where increased spending is followed by acceptance of a tax increase. Basically the results are similar across different measurement techniques. But if an interest group is identifiable - such as parents with young children - there is a distinct tendency for the interested party to be more supportive when money and budget restriction are involved compared with the pure recomendability of the programme. Interested parties also tend to support programmes that they are or will soon be using, most obviously seen in support for day care centres, which are supported largely by families with children below the age of 7 years, and for schools and education, supported largely by families with children above the age of 7 years. Where no distinct interest group - beyond the actual beneficiaries - is identifiable, normative positions such as ideology are the best predictor of support for welfare state programmes.},

Most of these attempts focus on false content and/or bad actors detection. In this paper, we argue for a wider ecological focus. Using the frame of media manipulation and a revised version of the 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' original definition, the paper presents a study based on an unprecedented combination of Facebook data, accessed through the CrowdTangle API, and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election. By focusing on actors' collective behavior, we identified several networks of pages, groups, and verified public profiles ('entities'), that shared the same political news articles on Facebook within a very short period of time. Some entities in our networks were openly political, while others, despite sharing political content too, deceptively presented themselves as entertainment venues. The proportion of inauthentic entities in a network affects the wideness of the range of news media sources they shared, thus pointing to different strategies and possible motivations. The paper has both theoretical and empirical implications: it frames the concept of 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' in existing literature, introduces a method to detect coordinated link sharing behavior and points out different strategies and methods employed by networks of actors willing to manipulate the media and public opinion.},

	abstract = {This article examines how the rise of social media affects the temporal relations of protest communication. Following a relational approach, it traces how regimes of temporality are constructed and transformed through the entanglement between media infrastructures, institutions, and practices. These regimes involve particular 'speeds' -the rate at which media content is renewed - as well as 'temporal orientations' towards present, past, and future. The article questions how specific temporal regimes enable or complicate protestors' efforts to gain public legitimacy. A large body of research suggests that it is difficult to gain such legitimacy in the mainstream news cycle, in which protest is primarily covered from an 'episodic' perspective, ignoring larger protest issues. The present analysis suggests that despite the participatory affordances of social media, it has not become any easier to generate sustained public attention for structural protest issues. Drawing examples from three case studies, it demonstrates that the dominant mode of social media protest communication reproduces and reinforces the episodic focus of the mainstream news. While other temporal perspectives on protest are certainly developed in the alternative and mainstream news, as well as in activist social media communication, these do not fundamentally challenge the prevailing temporal orientation towards the present, towards the event.},

We illustrate this claim by discussing how a greater focus on audiences and message reception, as well as message context, could advance the study of social movements. Specifically, we discuss a range of topics as applied to movement research, including information overload, selective attention, perceptions of bias, the possibilities that entertainment-related communications open up, and priming, among other topics. We suggest the risks of not adapting to this changing information environment, and incorporating insights from political communication, affect both the study of contemporary (including digital) protest, as well as potentially historical protest.

Drawing on existing literature on heuristics, we argue that voters are malleable to politicians' comparative framing of agriculture policies. Using an original survey experiment in the United States, we find that framing US agriculture as less generous than other countries generates an additional 12\% of respondents supporting increased farm payments to US farmers.

	abstract = {In this Essay, I argue that the main cause of the poisonous state of interbranch relations involving the federal judiciary, as of the frequent and strident attacks on courts federal and state-are strategies calculated to persuade the public that courts are part of ordinary politics and thus that judges are policy agents to be held accountable as such. Although unremarkable in the sense that a breakdown in norms of interdependence is a defining characteristic of contemporary politics, I regard the current situation involving the federal judiciary as remarkably dangerous because of the possibility that a tipping point of no return to the traditional equilibrium in interbranch relations may be reached. That prospect is suggested by the insight that our "tradition of judicial independence" has depended critically on the public's support of the courts irrespective of the decisions they make ("diffuse support"), and by research that provides reason to fear that the distinction between diffuse support and support depending on those decisions ("specific support") will disappear, leading people to ask of the judiciary not, "What does the law require?, " but rather, "What have you done for me lately?" I then turn to how, in the conduct of interbranch relations, the judiciary should respond to the impulses and incentives, both legitimate and illegitimate, that have brought us to this unhappy point. I conclude that successful interbranch relations require the institutional judiciary to avoid the attitudes and techniques of contemporary politics, but not to avoid politics, and that the main challenge in that regard is to avoid the perception that the federal judiciary is just another interest group. Finally, using the writings and career of the late Richard Arnold to exemplify what is needed in the politics of judging as well as the politics of the judiciary, I argue for judges to provide leadership in a return to norms of custom, dialogue, and statesmanship in interbranch relations. In order to do so, more federal judges will need to follow Arnold's example in recognizing that a presidential commission does not confer moral superiority; that judicial accountability, properly conceived, is essential for judicial independence; and that both 'posterity worship" (the attempt to control the future) and institutional aggrandizement are inimical to the long-term interests of the federal courts and the federal judiciary.},

We show that the number of voluntary associations in a policy area has a positive conditioning effect on the link between public priorities and attention for the president's State of the Union Address. However, our results do not find a positive effect for voluntary associations at later stages of the policy cycle, which experience a higher degree of institutional friction. The findings underline the importance of distinguishing between different stages of policymaking when considering the impact of voluntary associations on dynamic agenda responsiveness.},

However, policy change may actually be the result of public opinion, political opportunities, or other factors, thus creating a spurious relationship between SMO activity and policy outcomes. Interestingly, the power of the National Rifle Association (NRA) to influence policy is often assumed but seldom tested. Drawing on social movement and political-sociological theories of policy change, this study assesses NRA influence on state-level firearm policy outcomes using the case of concealed carry weapons (CCW) laws. Using event-history analyses, I find the NRA does influence CCW laws, but its effect is mediated by public opinion, political ideologies, competitive elections, and political opportunities. Issue-specific public opinion and political ideologies also interact with one another to influence CCW laws. These findings build upon a growing literature that illustrates how SMOs interact with political contexts to generate policy change.},

We contribute to the literature in developing a comprehensive rational-choice-based governance approach to analyze all stakeholder relationships of NGOs. Applying the research program of ordonomics, we unpack two fundamental interaction problems: (a) the "stakeholder dilemma" between the NGO and a single accountability holder as a one-sided social dilemma and (b) the "competition dilemma" among rival NGOs as a many-sided social dilemma. We show that improving NGO accountability in relation to intended beneficiaries, peer organizations, and the general public also requires identifying the underlying governance problem as a competition dilemma focusing on collective self-regulation as a solution.},

Opinion leaders are characterized by their unidirectional influence on other agents. We employ a model based on Axeirod's dynamics for cultural interaction among social agents that allows for non-interacting states. We find three collective phases in the space of parameters of the system, given by the fraction of opinion leaders and a quantity representing the number of available states: one ordered phase having the state imposed by the leaders; another nontrivial ordered phase consisting of a majority group in a state orthogonal or alternative to that of the opinion leaders, and a disordered phase, where many small groups coexist. We show that the spontaneous rise of an alternative group in the presence of opinion leaders depends on the existence of a minimum number of long-range connections in the underlying network. This phenomenon challenges the common idea that influentials are fundamental to propagation processes in society, such as the formation of public opinion. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study examined the perceived risks of allogeneic blood transfusions, preferences and willingness to pay for autologous donation and the desired role in the decision-making process in three populations: post-surgical patients, special interest group members and the general public. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 206 respondents with the help of computer-assisted semi-structured telephone interviews. Thirty-three per cent of the sample voiced concerns about receiving allogeneic blood transfusions. The risks of hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and a haemolytic reaction were perceived as being low, but were rated as numerically higher than those of other life events that have equal probability. Autologous donation was perceived as removing all the risks associated with transfusion, and respondents were willing to pay a median \$976 AUD (\$664 US) to use this technique. Over 80\% of respondents preferred to be involved in making the decision about whether to use autologous donation. Even though autologous donation is not 'risk-free' and the blood supply is very safe, people overestimate the associated risks and have a preference for their own blood. Decision aids presenting balanced information on the advantages and disadvantages of both allogeneic and autologous blood may be required.},

Recently NGOs have gone beyond diverse social issues to promote political reform. On 12 January 2000, Citizens' Alliance for General Elections (CAGE) - a loosely coupled coalition of NGOs formed to reform the nomination process and realize citizen political sovereignty - ousted 59 of 86 disfavored candidates from the political stage in the 16(th) General Elections in 2000. The coalition gained public support and persuaded the government to revise election law and readjust electoral constituencies. NGOs such as CAGE have thus become salient political actors and credible public institutions propelling democratic transition. Yet CAGE activities were never made legal and failed to mobilize voters - the 16(th), elections had the lowest voter turnout in Korean history left regional party monopoly intact, and provided no clear vision for political reform. CAGE inability to generate grassroots collective action exacerbated its own lack of focus, even as its success diminished the role of conventional political actors. These limitations, representing instructive dilemmas in the making of civil society, suggest that NGOs need to specify their functions, increase civic engagement, and promote citizen networks and cooperation for the common good in a society.},

We ask: When is disparaging humor seen as harmless fun or as a pernicious form of prejudice? What are the social and psychological processes through which bystanders confront, evade, or collaborate in disparaging humor? Three experiments (Ns = 95, 213, 220), involving a novel paradigm (`the shared media paradigm') test the role of bystander emotional responses (anger/amusement) in shaping action to confront disparagement humor, through emotion-based social influence. Study 1 demonstrates that bystander action to confront disparagement humor as prejudice is shaped by the angry (but not amused) responses of co-present others. Study 2 considers a moderator of the influence process: the role of one's own emotional reaction to disparagement humor (angry/amused). Bystander confrontation was more intense when one's own angry reaction was validated by that of other bystanders but there was otherwise mixed evidence that the two interacted to promote collaboration/confrontation. Study 3 tests the claim that disparagement humor is especially challenging to confront because humor disarms opposition. Intergroup commentary was seen as more amusing and confrontation was more strongly resisted when humor was used (vs. a non-humorous control remark). Overall, the results show that the reactions of bystanders play an important role in shaping what is (or is not) perceived to be prejudice. Courageous action to confront the disparagement of members of minority groups is enabled by the emotional signals of others who are co-present.},

Secondly, combined with the social network characteristics obtained from the data of Sina Micro-Blog, a synchronization evolution model of Internet public opinion based on Kuramoto one is established. Subsequently, evolutionary multi-objective optimization model is set up and the ABC method is used to optimize the level of network synchronization, the synchronization starting time and the cost of public opinion synchronization. Finally, case analysis on "Double Eleven" Internet Marketing as well as Cadmium Poisoned Rice Event demonstrates that the synchronization performance of weak coupled system can be enhanced by offering reasonable configuration of the connection cost and the synchronization duration cost. In addition, a certain degree of increase in input cost can promote the synchronization performance and extend the synchronization duration significantly.},

This article analyzes the impact that these violent episodes can have on popular support for the movement as a whole. To estimate the causal effect of violence, it exploits an unexpected riot outbreak that occurred during the fieldwork of a face-to-face survey in Barcelona in May 2016, led by a squat group linked to the anti-austerity movement known as the 15-M or indignados that emerged during the financial crisis. By comparing respondents interviewed before and after the riots, it finds that the street violence episode reduced support for the 15-M movement by 12 percentage points on average. However, the magnitude of the effect is highly conditional on the respondents' predispositions towards the movement. Core supporters, that are expected to share the frame of the movement in justifying violent actions, are the least affected by the violent outbreak. On the other extreme, weak supporters, opposers, and non-aligned citizens reduce their support to a larger extent. Results are robust to different specifications and a wide range of robustness checks. These findings have potentially important implications for movements concerned with broadening their support base.},

SMSAs (1) request large amounts of public and non-public data from organizations that maintain social media pages, (2) survey these organizations to collect additional data of interest to a researcher, and (3) return the results of a scholarly analysis back to these organizations as incentive for them to participate in social science research. SMSAs thus provide a highly efficient, cost-effective, and secure method for extracting detailed data from very large samples of organizations that use social media sites. This article describes how to design and implement SMSAs and discusses an application of this new method to study how nonprofit organizations attract public attention to their cause on Facebook. I conclude by evaluating the quality of the sample derived from this application of SMSAs and discussing the potential of this new method to study non-organizational populations on social media sites as well.},

	abstract = {In 1993 over 850 people were arrested for engaging in civil disobedience to prevent the clear-cut logging of pristine ancient temperate rainforests in Clayoquot Sound, Canada. This was the largest incident of this type in Canadian history, and has arguably been Canada's most visible mobilization over a specific environmental issue. This study examines the factors that explain the ongoing participation of individuals in the environmental movement (more broadly, beyond participation in civil disobedience) to protect Clayoquot Sound during the period following the 1993 protest. We focus on the roles of interpersonal social networks and movement identification, and compare their statistical effects with the effects of values and attitudes on the level of participation of individuals in the movement. We compare survey data from members of Friends of Clayoquot Sound (FOCS), a key environmental organization in this protest, with data collected from several surveys of the general public, and also from members of a local countermovement group (a proforest industry group that mobilized against the environmental movement). Although values and attitudes statistically differentiate members of FOCS from the other groups, these variables do not statistically explain ongoing differential participation in the movement amongst FOCS members. Rather, individual level of participation in this environmental movement is best explained by ego-network centrality (the pattern of ties each respondent has to contacts in the movement), as measured by the number of ties FOCS members have to others in a range of environmental organizations, and by their level of identification with the movement. Implications of this research for more recent mobilizations, such as against oil pipelines, are discussed, as are avenues for future research.},

The complex, established Legacy sectors' that resist change, particularly disruptive innovation, share common features that obstruct the market launch of innovations, over and above the valley of death' and other obstacles that have been the traditional focus of innovation policy. Innovations in Legacy sectors must penetrate a well-established and well-defended technological/economic/political/social paradigm that favours existing technology, characterised by (1) perverse' subsidies and price structures that create a mismatch between the incentives of producers and broader social goals, such as environmental sustainability, public health and safety, and geopolitical security; (2) established infrastructure and institutional architecture that imposes regulatory hurdles or other disadvantages to new entrants (3) market imperfections beyond those faced by other innovations: network economies, lumpiness, economies of scale, split incentives, needs for collective action, and transaction costs (4) politically powerful vested interests, reinforced by public support, that defend the paradigm and resist innovations that threaten their business models (5) public habits and expectations attuned to existing technology and (6) an established knowledge and human resources structure adapted to its needs. Beyond these obstacles, more socially desirable technologies that are driven by environmental or other non-market considerations must overcome the lack of agreed replacement standards against which putative alternatives can be judged. We have developed a new, integrative analytic framework for categorising the obstacles to market launch faced by Legacy sectors, and earlier applied this method to energy, health delivery, the long-distance electric grid, building, and air transport. In energy especially, the requirement for innovation is sufficiently urgent that large-scale domestic and collaborative international research should take place even at the cost of possible competitive disadvantage and even if it is some time before the USA adopts carbon charges and thereby puts pressure on the prevailing paradigm of fossil fuel use. We now extend this method to sustainable agriculture. American paradigms in agriculture and in energy are exported worldwide, delaying the development and spread of needed innovations that are not consistent with them. Foreign manufacturers wishing to enter US markets must suit their products in these sectors to American paradigms, while American exports of technology may be insufficiently cost conscious or respectful of environmental sustainability. Developing countries are technology takers and suffer from asymmetric innovative capability. They need to choose sources of technology best suited to their situation. India and China constitute new competitive threats, but also represent innovative developing countries' that have large domestic markets in which they are launching innovations aimed at their lower income populations.},

First, we show the variety of potential outcomes of armed groups' violent repertoires. We then review works on the consequences of social movements and highlight lessons for the study of armed groups. Specifically, we urge scholars to look for the interplay of internal and external factors in studying the impact of armed groups. We call for a comparative focus that dwells less on conditions and more on the processes and mechanisms affecting the impact of political violence. At the same time, we acknowledge that the literature on political violence and terrorism can inform social movement scholarship. In particular, students of social movements should pay more attention to the potential economic consequences of protest activities, the international factors constraining their impact, and the life-course patterns of movements' targets.},

By examining dominant interpretations of these events circulated in the news media alongside those of young people collected during a year of fieldwork in the public housing projects of a medium-sized French city, this paper shines light on fundamental French values and beliefs about how society ought to work while also contributing to ongoing debates about the cultural identity of such youth.

This social policy role has become increasingly important in the United States as the federal government continues to privatize health and human services through providing grant funds to states and cities that are ultimately used to support local nonprofit health and social service organizations. The important role of service-providing nonprofits in shaping local social policy has been understudied, as most studies on nonprofits and policy-making focus on citizen advocacy organizations and their lobbying and protest activities, primarily at the national level. This study uses the case of the New York HIV Planning Council to address this gap in the literature, highlighting the benefits and pitfalls of an urban community planning process dominated by service providers from local nonprofit social service organizations whose own organizations are affected by the planning group's decisions. Factors that contributed to nonprofit providers' dominance as well as factors that limited their self-interested behavior are reviewed. The relationship between the HIV nonprofit service system and the AIDS social movement is explored in light of theory on new social movements to help explain why nonprofit providers were sometimes able to promote attentiveness to the general public good while also advocating for their more self-interested organizational needs.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive commentary on the failure of health care reform, little systematic analysis has addressed the question of why reform became a national political issue in the early 1990s. Drawing on studies of agenda setting and examining opinion surveys, media coverage, and various measures of congressional activity, I identify the major factors that pushed health care reform onto the government agenda and explore the relationships among them. These factors fall into three categories: underlying structural changes in Congress and the interest group community that created a receptive climate for addressing health care reform; more immediate changes in the medical system, public opinion, media coverage, and the budgetary and political environments that increased attention to the issue; and a crucial political catalyst that thrust the issue to the top of the government agenda-the 1991 victory of Harris Wofford in a special Senate race in Pennsylvania. A content analysis of media coverage of that election reveals that journalists and politicians rapidly interpreted Wofford's triumph as a sign of broad-based public support for reform. This widely shared interpretation redefined the political risks and benefits of health care reform, creating an opportunity for legislative action. Partly because of the way reform reached the government agenda, however, this window of opportunity was more fragile than many believed. My argument thus has implications not only for agenda-setting research but also for the failure of national health legislation and the future possibilities for reform.},

We investigated whose attitudes will be most or least affected by the movement by considering individual differences pertaining to gender, gender and feminist identification, and social dominance orientation (SDO). Overall, dismissal of sexual assault reduced following \#MeToo among both men and women, and this change persisted six-months later. This effect was moderated by SDO such that low-SDO men and high-SDO women showed the most reduction in dismissal of sexual assault. We did not find a backlash effect as would be suggested by prior work, or by vocal criticism of \#MeToo.

I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.},

The results show that frame alignment depends on variables that tap into protesters' exposure to organizational and alternative messages. Participants who are recruited by staging organizations, and events organized by strong and more professionalized organizations, display higher levels of frame alignment, whereas salience of the protest issue in the political arena severely constrains frame alignment.},

The article also argues that the political opportunity structures within which feminists are embedded have been reconfigured over the course of the AKP's three terms in power, leaving the AKP in a stronger position to resist feminists' demands. This explains the paradox of an internally stronger and more dynamic social movement that, nevertheless, appears to have weakened vis-a-vis the state. Furthermore, because some recent legal reforms do not significantly reflect the AKP's or much of the public's preferences, the movement has been less able to generate implementation of recent policy changes.},

We extend the literature by focusing on pro-immigrant behavior, which we define as efforts initiated by established local residents and organizations to include immigrants in the larger community and/or to improve the lives of immigrants. In contrast to theories of group threat, we put forth the group inclusion model, and contend that demographic and political threats operate to break down rather than bolster group boundaries. We also find that when the increasing demographic and political presence of immigrants is coupled with the visibility of immigration, immigrant inclusion thrives. Using a data set of pro-immigrant collective action across 52 U.S. metropolitan areas, we generally find support for our model, and discuss the broader implications for immigrant-native relations.},

Such targeting can undermine their adversaries' ability or commitment to oppose the changes, thus relaxing the contrary pressure applied to politicians and reducing the resistance within government to progressive reform. We support this proposition by highlighting five instances in which mass pressure applied to institutional adversaries contributed to government policy change.

Evidence from a multivariate analysis of post-introduction data indicate that both drinking drivers and impaired drivers (based on self-reports) were more likely to recall the labels and their content, an indication that warning labels are reaching ”at risk” individuals. In addition, increases in the perceived risk of driving and drinking are consistent with the notion that warning labels, as one part of a larger social movement, are helping to create an atmosphere in which drinking and driving is less acceptable.

In democratic countries, these policy responses have elicited significant debate but little is known about the extent to which the responses are supported or opposed by the broader public. This article investigates how citizens across eight Western democracies evaluate the specific policies imposed by their governments to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The study relies on large-scale, longitudinal surveys that are reflective of the national populations (total N = 124,062). On this basis, it is investigated how pandemic-specific and broader political attitudes correlate with support for government responses during a significant part of 2020, a period marked by pandemic restrictions in all the countries. Medium to high levels of support for the government's responses are found in all eight countries. Beyond the regular voters of the government, support is driven by individuals high in interpersonal trust and self-assessed knowledge about COVID-19. This may suggest that halting the spread of COVID-19 is viewed as a collective action problem and mobilises support from those who know how to act and who trust others to act similarly.

Although organisational matters are inherent in most discussions in this area, there is a need for empirical insight into under-explored cases of citizen activism that can contribute toward addressing questions about the informal organisation of citizen activism and the associated role of social media. This paper presents an interview study of the role of Facebook in the informal organisation of the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan. The study found that participants in the Sunflower Movement engaged more with Facebook's information-spreading and information-sharing functions than with its networking affordances. They used these functions to enhance the public's engagement with the movement and recruit new participants, as well as to initiate, support and coordinate offline action. In addition, in the context of the Sunflower Movement, Facebook appeared to support the largely self-organised and loosely structured character of the coordination of offline action. It also fostered movement participants' actions and feelings of 'altruism' toward other participants as well as their desire to 'awaken' other groups and the public at large. Regarding leadership, the study shows that leadership structures still exist in technologically mediated citizen activism, but they are often challenged by activists, while decision-making is a lot more complex and multi-layered than in the past.},

It proposes that the duty to take reasonable precautions requires that agents make efforts to establish collective solutions to any essentially aggregative harm to which they would otherwise contribute. Baylor Johnson has argued that the general obligation to promote the common good requires that agents make efforts to establish a collective agreement to avert a potential tragedy of the commons. This article agrees with Johnson's analysis but argues that there are also negative duties, which give commons users additional moral reason to take collective action to prevent the destruction of the utility of the commons. These duties link commons users to resolving this particular problem and provide grounds to demand that they make greater efforts to prevent the destruction of the commons compared to bystanders. The article suggests that fulfilling negative duties can require establishing collective institutions with the power to regulate human action and interaction. This analysis could be applied to a range of social problems which result from the aggregation of actions and practices.},

We argue that the relationship between institutional opportunities and mobilization may take the form of trickle-down politics. In this view, activists are affected by political opportunities indirectly through the changes that political developments bring about in the immediate setting of protest. The political climate determines the distance between general public opinion and activists' view on society. The smaller this distance, the more likely it becomes that activists receive positive feedback, which results in further mobilization. We investigate how activists are influenced by bystander responses that are evoked by the wider political context. Statistical models indeed indicate that spatiotemporal fluctuations in political opportunities and public sentiments are translated into mobilization after activists receive feedback from bystanders. This suggests that bystander responses play a crucial role in linking political opportunities to mobilization.},

To examine whether meaningful differences in policy attitudes exist between the politically active and inactive within issue publics, we compare the policy attitudes of interest group members to nonmembers. Across ten interest groups we find uniformly consistent evidence of policy distinctiveness among group members and show that party identification and ideology largely account for the difference. We also find that the policy differences between members and nonmembers vary according to the primary incentive offered by an interest group. Groups primarily offering expressive benefits exhibit the greatest opinion differences within an issue public, whereas opinion differences are muted for groups emphasizing solidary or material incentives. Finally, we find evidence of attitude extremism among group members. Taken together, our study suggests that the voices of non-active citizens are not well represented within issue publics.},

How to formulate a pathway toward a sustainable society is a critical question. Several issues associated with this question are presented and discussed. First, a structuring of the issues is presented. The environment can be said to consist of three systems-the natural, social, and human-and their interactions; environmental problems may therefore be defined in terms of perturbations of the interactions among the three systems. A sustainable society can be realized by restoring these interactions. Next, the characteristics of the issues are discussed. Because environmental issues relate to the future, forecasts of the future are essential. Because it is impossible to predict the future with complete accuracy, however, we should develop a method of using information about the future with allowance for error. It should be noted that error characteristics differ according to their time-scale. Third, the relationship between environmental issues and society is discussed. To take collective action on these issues we need society-wide consensus, which requires a reliable and objective platform. Here, more attention must be paid to the distribution of knowledge across society, because scientific knowledge in a modern society tends to be monopolized by research organizations. The role of the media is therefore important. Another important factor is the commitment of the general public; user-friendly ways of galvanizing such commitment should be developed.},

Utilizing survey data from 133 business representatives and 326 public interest groups involved in federal forest policy, the study argues that public interest group influence derives primarily from the ability to mobilize human resources; the financial resources of these groups tend to be modest. Industry and industry-supported groups, in contrast, possess considerable financial power while enjoying less support from the public. Consequently, industry interests tend to focus their efforts on more traditional forms of influence such as the persistent lobbying of natural resource agencies and elected officials. Public interest groups, in contrast, tend to devote considerable efforts to building public support in urban core areas to build the capacity to pressure governmental decision-makers.},

Census data from the Summary Tape File 3 show that Latinos in South Central are virtually identical to Latinos living in neglected areas outside of South Central and not markedly different from more affluent Latinos in nonneglected areas. Thus Latino participation cannot be explained by virtue of internal composition. This article suggests that Latino participation can be better explained by using a collective behavior approach. The civil disturbance occurred in two distinct phases. The arson phase was a classic replay of the long, hot summers of the mid 1960s and showed elements of the solidaristic and expressive behavior so common to that period and did not have any noticeable Latino participation. The generalized looting phase, which did include noticeable Latino involvement, was individualistic and instrumental, akin to looting that often takes place in the case of a natural disaster In conclusion, it is noted that collective behavior can be quite useful in understanding Latino collective behavior fads, taste, and public opinion formation.},

Although it has become a global movement, to date, few studies have investigated the motivations behind people's participation in Earth Hour. The present study fills this gap by examining Earth Hour participation through the integration of the identity perspective and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). We argue that environmental self-identity and humanity identity motivate people to participate in Earth Hour via the pathways identified in the TPB. We tested our model by conducting a survey in Hong Kong (N = 239). Results from a series of mediation analysis revealed that Earth Hour-specific attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and moral norm were positively associated with behavioral intention, which in turn predicted actual participation. Further, we found that environmental self-identity and humanity identity were positively associated with attitude and moral norm, which in turn predicted behavioral intention. These results demonstrate the viability of integrating the identity perspective and the TPB to understand people's performance of specific pro-environmental behavior, including participation in collective action that aims to convert unconcerned individuals into active participants in environmental endeavors (i.e., conversionary collective action), such as Earth Hour. This integrated model can tell researchers and environmental practitioners not only which behavior-specific factors determine people's behavior but also how these behavior-specific factors arise in the first place.},

Here, we conduct a trend study to test the impacts of two back-to-back highly visible large-scale climate change related marches on bystanders, targeting psychological drivers of collective action: efficacy beliefs, perceptions of others' climate change activism and concerns, impressions of marchers, and behavioral intentions. Participants either completed a survey the day before the March for Science (n = 302) or several days after the People's Climate March, which occurred a week after the first march (n = 285). Results suggest that the marches were at least partially effective: bystanders' (a) collective efficacy beliefs and (b) impressions of marchers improved after the march. In contrast, marches were ineffective in increasing perceptions of others' engagement with concern about climate change. We anticipated that political leaning of bystanders' news sources would moderate effects of marches. Unexpectedly, collective efficacy beliefs improved among consumers of conservative, but not liberal, news. This unanticipated result is consistent with the notion that conservative news sources dedicated less coverage than liberal news sources to the marches prior to the marches (potentially leading to lower collective efficacy among those who consumed these sources), but that coverage afterwards was more equal across ideological bias of news sources. We also found that the more conservative the news sources consumed by an individual, the more negative impressions they had of marchers, and this relation was strongest among those that indicated, after the marches, that they had heard about the marches. These results on impressions are consistent with the notion that, when marches were covered, conservative news sources portrayed marchers relatively more negatively than liberal news sources. Overall, results suggest that marches can increase the likelihood that bystanders will participate in social movements via changes in psychological drivers of participation and the effects will likely depend upon political leanings of news sources via both whether sources mention the marches and how the sources cover the marches.},

We propose that within the context of Ukraine's intergroup conflict over the annexation of Crimea, supporters (but not opponents) of the "Euromaidan" social movement are likely to validate protesters' collective actions as just to the extent that they believe that the authorities are engaged in annexation-related conspiracies. We also examine the moderating role of perceived political corruption in these processes. Using a public opinion survey of 315 Ukrainians, we found support for our hypothesized moderated mediation model-identification with "Euromaidan" increased beliefs in the annexation-related conspiracy theories, which in turn, increased justification of protesters' actions in the setting of intergroup conflict. However, this mediation was only observed among those supporters of the Euromaidan who perceived political corruption to be at a low or average level.},

Yet questions remain about what motivates participation between those points on the causal chain, or under any conditions of high risk. To explain these anomalies, this article employs theories of moral identity to explore the interdependence of a facet of decision making that rationalist models typically regard as fixed: individuals' awareness of and need to express values central to their sense of self. Three mechanisms describe ways that individuals' responses to early risers trigger moral identity-based motivations for protest. First, by conjuring normative ideals, first movers can activate bystanders' urge to follow their example in order to earn their own self-respect. Secondly, by demonstrating the joy of agency, early risers can inspire bystanders' desire to experience the same gratification. Thirdly, by absorbing punishments, early risers can activate onlookers' sense of moral obligation to contribute to collective efforts. These mechanisms redouble bystanders' sense of the inherent value of protest, apart from its instrumental utility, and intensify their acceptance of risks, independent of the actual risks anticipated. Original interviews with displaced Syrians about their participation in demonstrations illustrate these processes.},

A country's experiences with nonviolent protests are associated with more support for peaceful demonstration and expression rights. Conversely, past experiences with violent dissent are associated with less individual-level support of these rights. These past experiences can demonstrate the efficacy of collective action. Using multilevel modeling techniques, we find support for our argument when it comes to public opinion regarding the right to peaceful demonstration. Our argument serves as another pathway through which a country's past experiences with protest could influence the nature of current dissent and human rights within a state.},

The authors distinguish relationships with five relevant actors: the internal members of the coalitions, allies, the general public, the Catholic Church as the major opponent, and government officials as the main target. As each relationship requires distinct emotion work, coalition members simultaneously adjust to contradictory emotional expectations while actively evoking and coordinating emotions.

For academics, writing op-eds offers an opportunity to publicize a book or other research findings, and to gain influence and attention for their ideas. Given a reward structure within the academy that stresses peer review publication, professors are at a decided structural disadvantage, compared to journalists, when they try to enter the op-ed space. Thus op-eds give us a useful window into how academics and public sociologists enter the public sphere in comparison to columnists, think-tanks, politicians, social movement activists, and corporate leaders. Drawing on the innovative theoretical approach outlined by Ronald Jacobs and Eleanor Townsley, this paper offers an analysis of a selected set of Canadian op-eds and suggests a research agenda for studying op-eds in Canada. Not surprisingly, we find that journalists dominate the space of the op-ed in Canada. We also find that sociologists are fairly underrepresented compared to our obvious competitors in the social sciences. We conclude with thoughts about the implications of our findings for further research in the sociology of sociology, public sociology and the study of the social space of opinion. We also offer informed suggestions regarding normative and practical issues that Canadian sociologists should consider in light of these broader empirical patterns.},

Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies. Prognostic frames shift from institutional reforms to those targeting group pathology. The author argues that excavating the latent mechanisms of racial projects helps us better understand the dynamic and ongoing processes of ethnoracial formation.},

This study analyzes these autism insurance mandates and demonstrates that while states have moved swiftly to introduce them, the generosity of the benefits they mandate insurers provide varies dramatically across states. Furthermore, our research finds that controlling for policy need, interest group activity, economic circumstances, the insurance environment, and other factors, the passage of these mandates and differences in their generosity are driven by the ideology of state residents and politicians-with more generous benefits in states with more liberal citizens and increased Democratic control of state government.

However, a norm violation may persist if only one person is required to sanction the norm breaker and everyone expects someone else to do it.

The symmetric VOD is a binary choice game in which all actors have the same costs of and benefits from cooperation and only one actor's cooperation is required to provide the collective good for the group. The asymmetric VOD differs from the symmetric VOD in one (strong) actor having lower costs of cooperation. In a laboratory experiment, we find that, in line with the diffusion of responsibility hypothesis, subjects' propensities to sanction the norm breaker decrease with group size in the symmetric VOD. In the asymmetric VOD, groups tacitly coordinate on the strong subject to sanction the norm breaker alone. Although at first lower in larger groups, strong subjects' sanctioning rates increase over time and reach equally high levels across different group sizes. Our results show that heterogeneous groups can be more effective in achieving norm compliance than groups of all equals because they naturally evade diffusion of responsibility in social norm enforcement.},

It shows consequences of a transition from traditional to social media campaigns and the effectiveness of social media at activating and moving public opinion during the general election campaign. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a data collection through a social media website, a classification of data set items by content attributes and a statistical analysis of the classified data. Findings Building on an empirical data set from Croatia, this study reveals that different political parties implement different election campaign strategies on social media to influence citizens who, consequently, respond differently to each of them. The results indicate that political messages with positive emotions evocate positive response from citizens, while neutral content is more likely to invoke negative comments and criticism, and support to the opponent. Another implication of the results is that two-way and tolerant communication of political actors increases citizen engagement, whereas unidirectional communication decreases it.

However, what moderating role perceived knowledge plays in influencing emphasis framing remains unsettled. We explore this relationship using a survey-experiment embedded within a large-N, nationally representative survey that allows us to test two specific hypotheses. First, we empirically test whether an emphasis frame influences policy support. Second, we test the moderating effect of perceived knowledge. We test the emphasis framing effects of the name given to a hot-button political issue, while controlling for other survey treatments. Furthermore, we evaluate the degree to which perceived knowledge of the issue moderates the relationship between the emphasis frame and support for hydraulic fracturing. We find support both for the role emphasis framing plays and for perceived knowledge as a moderator.},

Following recent criticisms of individual legal and moral responsibility for rape as a war crime in international law, this article examines how we might think of war rape as a collective action in moral and explanatory terms. First, it assesses existing moral arguments for the responsibility of men in groups for rape, primarily with reference to the work of Claudia Card, Larry May and Robert Strikwerda. Critiquing elements of these arguments, it explores the difficulties in talking about `men' as a coherent group and in discussing `collectives' themselves. Second, the article draws out the connection between accounts of moral responsibility and accounts of causal responsibility. Drawing on critiques of collective responsibility and the long-standing agency/structure problem, it argues that causal accounts focusing on structure pose a serious challenge to ideas of both individual and collective moral responsibility. The complexities of the relationship between moral and causal claims are illustrated through a discussion of Susan Brownmiller and Catharine MacKinnon's influential perspectives on rape. The seeming paradox of responsibility is emphasised as a problem to be addressed by gender and feminist perspectives that seek to pursue both ethical and explanatory inquiry into the workings of masculinity and the political means for undoing gendered wrongs.},

This paper examines statewide ballot propositions concerning prohibition and repeal within the state of Texas. Archival searches uncovered county-level election results for over a dozen state liquor referenda held between 1887 and 1935. Texas was a critical state for the prohibition movement, and election data provide a new and dynamic opportunity to investigate the social and political coalitions that led to prohibition and, later, repeal. Empirical tests confirm many relationship expectations between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and voting behavior but find the religious element overstated and economic factors underestimated. Prohibition referenda were supported by progressives and those living in rural areas. Prohibition was opposed by the poor, Catholics, Germans, and city residents. Temperance, prohibition, and its repeal involved issues that cut across partisan and ideological orientations. Influences on voting behavior included progressivism, status inconsistency, and group norms, all of which interacted to produce a half-century of volatile electoral politics.

Utilising a new survey with a considerable oversample of Latino respondents, the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), this paper investigates the role that collective identities, racialisation, and social networks play in Latino support for contemporary immigrant rights activism. To do so, we incorporate measures such as linked fate, perceptions of anti-immigrant sentiments, knowing undocumented people, and concerns about immigration enforcement policies. The results of our analysis indicate that some of the same factors that influenced Latino engagement in the 2006 mobilisations, such as identity and racialisation, concerns over enforcement, and social networks, continue to impact Latino support for contentious politics on behalf of the foreign-born. We also find evidence that political party and past protest activity, play a significant role in explaining levels of support for activism. Our results have important implications for understanding how anti-immigrant policies and racialized nativism influence Latino support for contentious politics.},

The analysed protest movements reacted to the socio-economic crisis in the countryside which entails a continuous decline of smallholder farming, a process that has started during the 1989 Polish transformation and has intensified following the introduction of the Common Agricultural Policy in the country. It is argued that - due to the prevalence of the modernisation paradigm in the Polish public sphere - the alliance of farmer movements with urban consumer groups would foster legitimacy of the food sovereignty discourse and bring about creation of a strong social movement that could influence public opinion and state policy. However, while the analysed groups of farmers and urban consumers share some goals, their discourses on food and agricultural issues differ, immersed in different worldviews and visions of the countryside. A successful translation of the food sovereignty discourse into the Polish context requires a careful navigation between religious and conservative values, important for family farmers, and the more universal 'cosmopolitan' ideas promoted by urban consumers.},

In recent elections, individual contributors have grown more closely affiliated with activist organizations, such as environmental and anti-abortion groups. Contributions from these group-affiliated contributors predict legislative extremism at least as well as overall contributions from interest groups, individual donors, party committees, and party-affiliated individuals. Using a novel data set of state legislative primary dates, results suggest that this relationship may be concentrated in the nomination process.

	abstract = {What type of information helps interest advocates get their way? While it is widely acknowledged in the academic literature that information provision is a key aspect of lobbying, few scholars have directly tested the effect of information on lobbying success. Policymakers need information both on technical aspects and public preferences to anticipate the effectiveness of a policy proposal and electoral consequences. However, scholars have found that interest groups predominantly provide the former rather than the latter, which suggests that technical information is seen as more efficient. The paper argues that lobbying success is not solely a function of the provision of any information but of the specific type of information and its composition. It furthermore argues that the relevance of different information types for lobbying success depends on issue characteristics such as public opinion, salience or complexity. Relying on new original data of advocacy activity on 50 specific policy issues in five West European countries, the paper highlights that the provision of expert information increases the likelihood of lobbying success, while the effect of information about public preferences is, if anything, negative.

The Arannas' are predominantly older women who undertake non-violent direct action using fibre craft, knit-ins, lock-ons, and occasional street theatre to draw public attention to the negative environmental impacts of unconventional coal seam gas extraction ('fracking') and of fossil fuel mining. We identify the characteristics of Nannagogy as a hybrid system of lifelong / later-in-life learning and a complex pedagogy of informal learning that can be understood through social movement learning theory (SML) drawing on Paolo Freire's (1970) original concept of `conscientisation'. Nannagogy is an act of radical adult education that has its antecedents in feminist collective learning strategies such as consciousness raising as well as the formal education strategies of action learning and communities of practice. Nannagogy is highly effective adult learning practice at the intersection of adult learning theory and social movement theory. Data presented in this paper were collected with active KNAG members in Australia as part of a PhD study using surveys, interviews, document analysis of social media (Facebook posts, digital videos, e-news bulletins) and researcher autoethnography. Framing activist adult learning as social movement learning locates environmental and climate justice struggles within lifelong learning practices and enables researchers to better understand the complex processes of informal, situated and often spontaneous adult learning for creating and sustaining movements for social, environmental and political change.},

Social similarity between an individual and their neighbors will also affect their opinions in real life. Therefore, an opinion evolution model considering social similarity (social-similarity-based HK model, SSHK model for short) is introduced in this paper. Social similarity is calculated using individual properties and is used to measure the social relationship between individuals. By considering the joint effect of confidence bounds and social similarity in this model, the role of neighbors' selection is changed significantly in the process of the evolution of opinions. Numerical results demonstrate that the new model can not only obtain the salient features of the opinion result, namely, fragmentation, polarization, and consensus, but also achieve consensusmore easily under the appropriate similarity threshold. In addition, the improved model with heterogeneous and homogeneous confidence bounds and similarity thresholds are also discussed. We found that the improved heterogeneous SSHK model could acquire opinion consensus results more easily than the homogeneous SSHK model and the classical models when the confidence bound was related to the similarity threshold. This finding provides a new way of thinking and a theoretical basis for the guidance of public opinion in real life.},

While these are necessary elements to understand, their reification neglects the critical element of process.

A messy assemblage of actors and interests shapes both the design and the outcome of distribution. Qualitative analysis of the federal agency in charge of land reform in Brazil, the Instituto Nacional de ColonizacAo e Reforma Agraria (National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian ReformINCRA), reveals that, in the context of increased citizen participation and reduced funding, the agency must work together with social movement activists to perform its task.

On the presumption that public opinion matters for government policy, we examine how citizens view this shift in climate policy from reciprocity to unilateralism, after many years of exposure to strong reciprocity rhetoric by governments and stakeholders. To that end, we fielded a survey experiment in China, the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter. The results show that there is, perhaps surprisingly, strong and robust public support for unilateral, non-reciprocal climate policy. To the extent China is interested in pushing ahead with ambitious and thus costly GHG reduction policies, our results suggest that China can leverage segments of public support in order to overcome domestic obstacles to GHG mitigation policies.},

It concludes by affirming that-contrary to many analysts of Chiapas's 1994 indigenous rebellion-external influences (here state-established land tenure institutions) can trump ideology in framing social movements.

I assess this theory in one, salient policy area, medical malpractice. I measure conflict with contributions for state candidates given by (i) the health and insurance industries, which generally support malpractice laws, and (ii) lawyers, who frequently oppose the laws. I find that group conflict matters to policy outcomes. I also find evidence that, under conditions of elevated conflict, adopted policies are more likely to move toward the general ideological preferences of the public at large.

Two exceptions include smoke-free legislation for child care facilities and schools. While public interest group health advocates have traditionally used insider lobbying of public officials in the "halls of power" to pass smoke-free legislation, this should be supplemented with astute outsider advocacy tactics such as public demonstrations or issue advertisements to increase the likelihood of passage of more state-level smoke-free legislation.},

	volume = {54},
	issn = {0036-0465},
	abstract = {Governments tend to enforce vice laws-i.e., criminal laws targeting consensual but morally disreputable conduct-sporadically. Existing scholarship generally attributes this underenforcement strategy to a variety of case-specific factors, such as budgetary constraints, fluctuating public support, and interest-group pressures. The Author argues that governments generally underenforce vice laws because, excluding draconian enforcement strategies unlikely to pass a social cost-benefit test, this enforcement strategy is likely to minimize participation in vice offenses. Specifically, the Author argues that "strong" (but less than draconian) enforcement strategies-i.e., regularly applying criminal sanctions to vice offenses- are likely to generate more vice offenses than "weak" enforcement strategies-i.e., infrequently applying criminal sanctions combined with public education campaigns. This result, which runs counter to the standard economic prediction that increasing the cost of an activity reduces its incidence, is likely to occur because regularly attaching a formal "price" to a vice offense reduces marginal offenders' expected informal penalties for relaxing a principled commitment to the underlying moral norm. If strong enforcement cannot compensate for the lost deterrent effect of these extralegal penalties, then it may perversely increase the offense rate. At the same time, symbolically maintaining (but usually neglecting to enforce) criminal penalties for a vice activity, coupled with intensive public education, reinforces marginal offenders' intrinsic commitment to the relevant moral norm, thereby lowering the offense rate as desired. Given the foregoing, governments that wish to minimize participation in a particular vice activity (without violating the cost-benefit test) will rationally select weak enforcement over the alternative strategies of draconian enforcement, strong enforcement, and zero enforcement. This argument relies in part on established findings in the social psychological literature and more recent findings in the experimental economics literature. It also is weighed against, and finds support in, empirical evidence concerning historical and contemporary enforcement policies and results in several major vice industries.},

	abstract = {The task of those who seek to encourage and offer social support has become more difficult as the majority of social institutions, and the state have established, over time, stronger and more pervasive modes of communication. The intricacies of gay identity have been articulated largely by forces outside of the gay movement, with the inevitable result that GSOs and ASOs have occupied less space in the consciousness of gay men. Additionally, I hypothesize that men who are HIV-positive are engaging in fewer sexual contacts than men who are HIV-negative, and consequently lessening their attendance at venues where cruising is the main event. Financially and structurally, I shall demonstrate the disparity between GSOs and ASOs, and suggest that there is a natural intersection wherein the two SMOs could, and ought to cooperate, especially in the areas of fund-raising, joint program development, recruitment and political lobbying. However, their ideological bases appear to be sufficiently different to preclude such affiliations. These disparate ideologies are amplified by the mass media, and are consequently internalized by the members of the gay community. In the longer term, the divisiveness that manifests itself in the proliferation of numerous collectivities within the gay movement will contribute to the further isolation of gays from each other, and thwart any future attempts at coalition building, which could obviate the continued existence of a gay movement. Some writers suggest that the gay movement is going through a phase in an inevitable process of paradigm shifting, and in the end, the community will come back together-stronger and more unified than it was previously. However, if this is a phase it is clear that the gay movement is in the 'dark before the dawn' initial phase of this paradigmatic shift, and subsequent phases are by no means guaranteed. As AIDS spreads beyond marginalized groups, and infiltrates the social majority, it is possible that much of the discrimination that has positioned gay men as 'other' will be abandoned in favour of a more enlightened, pluralistic conviction of the humanity of gays as full-fledged members of a mosaic-type community structure. On the other hand, It is also possible that as AIDS spreads into mainstream Western communities, gays will be further vilified and scapegoated as the perpetrators of this deadly disease. Preventative action is required to offset this possibility-preventative action can be affected by building a strong and unified gay community ready to withstand the onslaught of the mainstream enmity. This action would frame AIDS and gayness such that this type of situation would not come about. What is required is a new mode of co-operation among ASOs and GSOs, a model which firstly puts the gay house in order, and is then suitably structured to be more inclusive of all gay men's needs, and positioned to assist in the second wave of HIV infection-the general public.},

We argue that Germany's resistance to reduce its massive current account surplus through an expansionary policy at home is rooted in distributive struggles about the design of possible adjustment policies. To explore this argument, we leverage original survey data from 135 German economic interest groups, qualitative interviews with interest group representatives and policymakers, and data from public opinion surveys. We show that while there is general support for internal adjustment among German interest groups, they disagree heavily about which specific policies should be implemented to achieve this goal. Together with a broad public and elite-based consensus to avoid a break-up of the Eurozone, this polarization turns financing into a politically attractive strategy. Rather than being rooted only in German ordoliberal ideas or Germany's export-oriented structure, distributive conflicts contribute significantly to Germany's resistance to reduce its large current-account surplus. Because similar dynamics can be observed in other surplus countries, we argue that distributive struggles within surplus countries played an important role in interstate conflicts about the management of the crisis.},

	abstract = {How do consumers hold sellers accountable and enforce market norms? This Article contributes to our understanding of consumer markets in three ways. First, the Article identifies the role of a small subset of consumers-the titular "nudniks"-as engines of market discipline. Nudniks are those who call to complain, speak with managers, post online reviews, and file lawsuits. Typified by an idiosyncratic utility function and certain unique personality traits, nudniks pursue action where most consumers remain passive. Although derided in courtrooms and the court of public opinion, we show that nudniks can solve consumer collective action problems, leading to broad market improvements. Second, the Article spotlights a disconcerting development: sellers' growing usage of big data and predictive analytics allows them to identify specific consumers as potential nudniks and then disarm or avoid selling to them before they can draw attention to sellers' misconduct. The Article therefore captures an understudied problem with big data tools: sellers can use these tools to shield themselves from market accountability. Finally, the Article evaluates a menu of legal strategies that would preserve the benefits of nudnik-based activism in light of these technological developments. In the process, we revisit the conventional wisdom on the desirability of form contracts, mandatory arbitration clauses, defamation law, and standing doctrines.},

In this contribution, we assess a series of plausible explanation for these very varying degrees of politicization across EU trade agreement negotiations-conceived of as the combination of polarization of opinions, salience given to them in public debate, and the expansion of the number of societal actors involved therein. Through a review of existing explanations, we show how each of these explanations faces a set of challenges. In the third section, we argue it is useful to conceive of these existing explanations as structural background conditions enabling agency on the part of interest group and civil society organizations. We therefore close by sketching how literature on the relationship between interest group mobilization and public opinion could inform further comparative research on trade policy negotiations, and on politicization of EU policy making in general.},

	abstract = {Many outdoor garments are impregnated to make them water and, in some cases oil repellent, but the impregnation agents can be hazardous to human health and the environment. Some examples of such hazardous impregnation agents include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. To reduce the risks related to these fluorinated substances, a phase-out is necessary, and voluntary avoidance by consumers may be one way to make this happen. This experimental survey investigates the extent to which information about the hazardous properties of fluorinated substances affects consumer willingness-to-pay for alternative outdoor garments without hazardous chemicals. The experiment was conducted by means of a questionnaire distributed to more than 4000 Swedish respondents via the Laboratory of Opinion Research's Citizen Panel. The results show a generally high willingness-to-pay, and that the effects of providing information are higher when the price increase is high. This suggests that there is room for a price increase if the non-hazardous options are more expensive. This survey experiment indicates that the Swedish general public is ready for substitution to garments without hazardous fluorinated chemicals if the alternative provides an identical function. Information campaigns, however, will have limited ability to increase the willingness-to-pay for an alternative as it is already high. Despite the general willingness of the Swedish public to choose less hazardous options, legislative measures may potentially be the most effective action when supply chains are opaque and information to consumers is limited.

It seeks to identify the main reasons accounting for the movement's success, which appear to be connected to the breadth of its repertoire of actions, progressively expanded to include various (and sometimes innovative) strategies operating in both the realm of civil society and public opinion and the sphere of political institutions and political representation. Focusing on the dyad speech action, the article examines the movement's broadened repertoire of actions as well as its discourse setting human rights as a horizon of legitimacy in the context of a cultural war against a countermovement organized in defense of the status quo. Last but not least, it analyzes the issues pertaining to political representation brought to the forefront by the clashes, discrepancies, and disconnections between social movement and political institutions.},

Common explanations cite employment shifts, public opinion, labor laws, and differences in working class culture and organization. But comparing the United States with Canada challenges those explanations. After following US unionization rates for decades, Canadian rates diverged in the 1960s, and are now nearly three times higher. This divergence was due to different processes of working class political incorporation. In the United States, labor was incorporated as an interest group into a labor regime governed by a pluralist idea. In Canada, labor was incorporated as a class representative into a labor regime governed by a class idea. This led to a relatively stronger Canadian labor regime that better held employers in check and protected workers' collective bargaining rights. As a result, union density stabilized in Canada while plummeting in the United States.},

	abstract = {While previous research documents a negative relationship between government size and economic growth, suggesting an economic cost of big government, a given government size generally affects growth differently in different countries. As a possible explanation of this differential effect, we explore whether government legitimacy (measured by satisfaction with the way democracy works) influences how a certain government size affects growth. On the positive side, a government perceived as legitimate may "get away" with being big since legitimacy can affect behavioral response to, and therefore the economic growth cost of, taxation and government expenditures. On the negative side, perceived legitimacy may make voters less prone to acquire information, which in turn facilitates interest-group oriented or populist policies that harm growth. A panel-data analysis of up to 30 developed countries, in which two different measures of the size of government are interacted with government legitimacy, reveals that perceived legitimacy exacerbates a negative growth effect of government size in the long run. This could be interpreted as governments taking advantage of being regarded as legitimate in order to secure short-term support at a long-term cost to the economy.},

In 2007 families were advised by public agencies to establish community-company partnerships for forest management (FM) in this settlement. Operations in 3,000 ha extracted 50,000 m(3) of timber, generating gross revenues of US\$ 2 million for the local association. This paper examines collective action in key stages of land access and FM. The impacts of the FM process on social structures are explored. Since recent regulations have prohibited private companies to control FM in agrarian reform settlements, local administrative efforts need to change. We will thus evaluate prospects for a system of governance under direct coordination of producers' organisations. Management changes are seen as positive if combined with public support for local capacity building, but this is unlikely in the short term. Given limits for agricultural land use, effective FM is critical for these groups in order to consolidate land occupation and properly manage natural resources.},

National survey data are introduced to operationalize the mechanisms proposed in the horizontal inequality literature on the individual level. Results point to the operation of political and economic horizontal inequality mechanisms in the Palestinian case. Higher perceived status of civil and political rights is associated with a lower probability of supporting violent over nonviolent resistance. Individuals are also more likely to support violent over nonviolent resistance the larger the difference in household expenditure and consumer durable ownership between their own region and the closest Israeli subdistrict. Corresponding differences in educational attainment have no corresponding effect. The results demonstrate how economic and political horizontal inequality can increase the risk that an individual becomes part of the mobilizational potential of violent social movements. This can lead to participation in a wide range of supportive actions that increase the viability of such movements, ranging from material support to direct participation in violence. The level of public support for violent resistance in key constituencies could also influence public opinion sensitive actors like Hamas in their choice between violent and nonviolent resistance strategies.},

As climate change impacts vary with locality, local adaption is important; however there are few processes that build awareness and engagement of householders with climate adaptation and planning. Using reports of discussions from 96 groups convened as part of a climate change engagement program called Energymark; this paper explores the concerns of householders around climate change and provides a lay perspective on climate adaptation. Analyses of group discussions reveal that householders were unable to readily distinguish between climate adaptation and mitigation actions. Groups discussed how they could increase local adaptive capacity through active citizenship and community action. This applied research provides empirical evidence of how deliberation can build social capital and contribute to local adaptive solutions. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The present research explores the effect of perpetrator power on bystander efficacy and collective action, as well as the moderating role of impact of the injustice event. Across two experiments, bystanders perceived that collective action would be less effective and were less willing to engage in collective action when a high-power perpetrator engaged in injustice, compared with a low-power perpetrator. These effects were moderated by impact of the injustice event, such that the effects of power were especially present under conditions of large impact (many victims), compared with small impact (fewer victims). Whereas the effect of the interaction of perpetrator power and impact on bystander efficacy was explained by perceptions of normativity of the injustice event, the effect of the interaction on bystander collective action was explained by bystander efficacy. Implications for bystander collective action and social change are discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

How does the racial-political context influence anti-immigration lawmaking? In what ways does this influence vary at different stages of lawmaking? To address these questions, we combine comprehensive datasets of racially conservative organizations and state immigrant legislation and use negative binomial regression to estimate the count of anti-immigrant bills and laws in the fifty states from 1991 to 2010. We find that the presence of racially conservative organizations encourages the introduction of exclusionary proposals, but only in contexts with a Republican-dominated government. At the approval stage, on the other hand, racially conservative organizations foster the passage of exclusionary laws, and this effect is heightened in contexts with a growing foreign-born population or where a majority of voters report anti-immigrant opinions or identify as conservative. This indicates that the institutionalization of the colorblind racial ideology (in the form of racially conservative organizations) resonates with lawmakers, but in a different manner when the stakes are higher. These findings have important implications and challenge previous research on the conditions under which advocacy organizations influence lawmaking and additional forms of group behavior.},

The government colludes with the special interests if the value of political support exceeds the cost. However, if the government colludes with special interests in country A, the payoff to the government and special interests in country B also decreases because the probability of successful international cooperation decreases. In equilibrium, special interests create a collective-action problem that complicates international cooperation. In addition to providing a new explanation for the power of special interests in international cooperation, the article illuminates how international negotiations and domestic treaty implementation interact.

Design/methodology/approach - The research in this paper is based upon theoretical concepts of central government and local accountability over policing; policy making and implementation; and pressure group influence. Documents issued to local police forces from Central Government were examined and compared to local policy documents to assess their affect over local police policy. Using a structured format, senior managers were interviewed to gain their impressions of these influences. Views of ground level staff were obtained through postal questionnaires. Findings - This paper finds public opinion and pressure from academic research upon Central Government has resulted in a very strong central influence over local police policy and practice. Police officers believe that these influences have had a major affect upon the way that they respond to domestic violence issues at a local level, to the point where both managers and front line police officers believe that their discretion in dealing with these issues has been curtailed, and that top down control over police practice has increased. Police attitudes towards policing domestic violence are more enlightened than they once were. Originality/value - This paper examines the opinions of both senior local police policy makers and front line policy implementers and will be of value to those interested in the policing of domestic violence issues.},

We model individuals as naive Bayesian norm followers, rational agents whose subjective expected utility is increased by adherence to an established norm. Agents use Bayesian reasoning to combine their private preferences and prior beliefs with empirical observations of others' decisions. When agents must infer the preferences of others from observation, this can result in negative cascades, causing the majority of agents to choose a dispreferred action (because they believe, incorrectly, that they are following the majority preference). We demonstrate that negative cascades can result even when the degree of conformity is relatively low, and under a wide range of conditions (including heterogeneity in preferences, priors, and impact of public opinion). This allows us to present a general model of how rational norm-following behavior can occur, and how unpopular norms might emerge, in real populations with heterogeneous preferences and beliefs.},

The AOP movement brings the politics of Thailand's rural poor to the public arena, within which it manifests its grievances and, at the same time, it proposes an ideological critique of state-imposed development and articulates oppositional visions of an alternative bottom-up development. The article shows how the discursive struggle over media visibility and representation has been central to the making and unmaking of the movement. The AOP's presence in media space has allowed it to bring counter-perspectives to public attention, thereby creating a nationwide conversation about the grievances of poor villagers, rallying support for AOP causes and actions, and heightening the possibility for entering into dialogue with the government concerning state development projects. The article also points out, however, that the media plays a pivotal role in managing the space of public communication, deciding if and how the AOP should be represented (though not without constraints) - and this may have detrimental effects. Media space is thus a central site of ideological and political contestation that no social movement can afford to dismiss, if it desires political change.},

Using hearing testimony, media coverage, and other data, we test this proposition by examining alterations to U.S. transportation policy in the 1990s. The reauthorizations of the federal transportation law in 1997 and 1998, which shifted considerable discretion away from states and toward previously weak metropolitan planning organizations, are typically viewed as major victories for mass transit and environmentalists. Our analysis suggests that a conventional explanation focusing on national factors like public opinion, interest group involvement, and Congressional membership provides less leverage in accounting for these substantive and procedural policy shifts than an explanation centered on local and intergovernmental factors.},

During the same period, the Mobile public changed its views of busing for school desegregation to be consistent with the new redefinition of the problem of race. The rapid change in the public's views of race and busing was not explained by objective measures of racial conditions in Mobile or by media coverage of these topics.

Using a sample of 410 acquisition deals from 22 foreign countries/economies into China during 2010-2017 and a sentiment analysis of 100,902 blog posts, we find that a host country's public sentiment toward the acquiring firm's home country is positively related to acquisition ownership levels, and has a mutualistic symbiotic interaction with the host region's marketization level. Our study contributes to the study of informal institutions by proposing public sentiment as a new form of informal institution that is normative-cognitive whilst affective, and can be mobilized and communicated broadly and timely via a public sphere to confer social, political, and cognitive legitimacy to MNCs.},

Using a qualitative inquiry and research design involving a case study of the Wet'zinkw'a Community Forest Corporation, this paper presents research that examined the relationships between collective action and social learning through community forest management. Our findings show strong evidence of collective action outcomes on the part of board members responsible for the community forest, such as establishing a legacy fund, adding value to logs, protecting First Nations cultural values, and hiring locally. Our data also reveal that the actions taken by board members were encouraged through social learning that was related to acquiring (new) knowledge, developing an improved/deeper understanding, and building relationships. However, we found limited opportunities for community forest partners and the general public to learn and contribute to collective action outcomes since the actions taken and associated learning occurred mainly among board members.},

Our findings identify six themes that contributed to the climate of increased partisanship and politicization, and helped shape perceptions about the Common Core, both within the education sector and among the broader public. We argue that these policy factors, strategic factors, and contextual factors played an important role in shaping the environment within which the CCSS were being understood and implemented.},

However, an approach that considers people's perceptions on these conditions is still absent in the social psychological literature. Subjective Political Openness (SPO) is a new construct which fills this gap by incorporating features of political context into the psychological analysis of protests. We propose that SPO comprises perceptions relating to three dimensions: government actions to allow/restrict protests, police measures to actively prevent them, and the extent that public opinion legitimizes protests. We conducted two studies in the UK and Chile to validate scales created for each proposed dimension, test their measurement invariance, establish SPO's configuration, and demonstrate its convergent validity. Participants in Study 1 were university students (n UK = 203; n Chile = 237), whereas in Study 2 a general population sample from both countries was included (n UK = 377; n Chile = 309) with the purpose of generalizing the results. Both studies consistently showed that SPO is a multidimensional construct configured as a bifactor model comprising the dimensions associated with perceptions of the government and police actions to confront protests. Although we tested two different measurement scales for the perceived legitimacy given by public opinion to protests, results demonstrated this dimension is not part of SPO. The SPO configuration has implications for both our understanding of collective action and how we study it.},

We surveyed two student samples exactly one week apart at the same time and location, first in the absence of protest and then again at the time of a racial justice protest (Total N = 240). We found that participants who believed that racism was not a problem on campus had more negative attitudes toward racial justice protests and protesters, as well as lower support for anti-racist efforts on campus on the day of the protest, compared to the day without a protest.

Institutionalized strategies are routine ways of addressing problems that become taken-for granted in a society. Environmental problems constitute a collective action problem in that personal consumption often conflicts with collective interests. I test whether beliefs about environmental problems have a different impact on a person's pro-environmental behaviors, depending on how addressing collective action problems is institutionalized in their society. In particular, I use level of welfare targeting as an observable, organizational difference among societies that reflects different institutionalized strategies for addressing a prominent collective action problem. I use multilevel models on data from the 2010 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and measures of welfare targeting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to answer this question. I find that in societies where the institutionalized strategy for dealing with inequality is highly targeted, individuals' beliefs that these problems are important, real, and whether they can do something about them have a greater impact on their actions. The results suggest individuals generalize taken-for-granted strategies of assuring collective welfare to implement their individual beliefs about the environment, making institutional environments important moderators of the strength of the belief action relationship.},

She contends that only a race-conscious social movement that engages both legal actors and the public can dismantle this system of racial control. Unfortunately, very little research has examined views about carceral inequality. Little is known about the attitudes of juvenile and criminal justice workers. We build on and integrate three literaturesscholarship on the framing perspective, comparative conflict theory, and group position theory and racial ideologyto develop a theoretical model of attitudes toward carceral inequality. We hypothesize that race influences the resonance of attributional frames, especially criminal injustice frames, but endorsement of these frames represents the primary factor shaping judgments about whether carceral inequality is a social problem (propriety, urgency, severity and policy frames). For several decades, framing efforts have been underway aimed at mobilizing JCJW to reduce racial disparities in the juvenile justice system. And most offenders first have contact with the state as juveniles. Accordingly, to test our theory, we analyze data on views about carceral inequality in the juvenile justice systemor disproportionate minority contactamong a nationwide sample of justice workers (N = 543). The findings show that race is strongly associated with attributional frames about carceral inequality, and is indirectly related, through attributional frames, to endorsement of propriety, urgency, severity, and policy frames about carceral inequality.},

Based on an original dataset, we analyze more than 10,000 protest events that took place in Turkey between 2000 and 2009. Our findings suggest that compared to others, pro-Kurdish events are more likely to encounter police action, one that particularly involves repressive strategies. We further show that repressive policing in pro-Kurdish events is more pronounced when the Kurdish armed insurgency against the state intensifies. Given that this is the first systematic quantitative study on protest policing in Turkey, it not only tests previously confirmed theories of protest policing, but also makes a theoretical contribution by providing a dynamic notion of threat beyond its situational forms, which builds on the conflict between the Turkish state and the PKK.},

We evaluate this model using a survey of southern California electricity customers, with results indicating the model's utility in predicting public support of EEP. Stronger community ties are associated with preferences for "pull"-type subsidies, whereas stronger connections to natural commons are linked to support for both "pull" and "push"-type sanctions. Findings have implications for coalition building as advocates may engender support for green energy policy by framing sanctions as protecting natural commons, and framing subsidies either in this same way and/or as producing benefits for communities.

Drawing on public opinion polls from the Palestinian Territories, the article shows that the resonance of Hamas' frames vis-a-vis the peace process between 1993 and 2006 depended on the ability of the Palestinian leadership to maintain its legitimacy. Since the Gaza take-over and Hamas' shift to a position of leadership rather than opposition party, the organization's inability to deliver in the economic realm or to even feign any progress regarding the peace process damaged its credibility and reputation. Accordingly, its frames vis-a-vis the peace process also started losing their resonance with the public.

So far, little evidence supports any improvement in Korea's drug distribution system. Instead, the new drug pricing policy has deteriorated Korea's national health insurance budget, indicating a heavier economic burden for the general public, From Korea's experience, we may draw some lessons for the future development of a better health care system. As a society becomes more pluralistic, the government should come out of authoritarianism and thoroughly prepare in advance for resistance to reform, by making greater efforts to persuade strong interest groups while informing the general public of potential benefits of the reform. Additionally, facing developing civic groups, the government should listen but not rely too much on them at the final stage of the policy formation.

While public opinion is sensitive to the cost attributes of carbon taxes, we find that in some cases, opposition to carbon taxes can be offset by a reduction in income taxes. However, these effects tend to be modest in size, limited to some ideological groups, and varied across countries.

The established method for quantifying this cell-substrate interaction is traction force microscopy (TFM). In spite of recent advancements, inference of the traction forces from measurements remains very sensitive to noise. However, suppression of the noise reduces the measurement accuracy and the spatial resolution, which makes it crucial to select an optimal level of noise reduction. Here, we present a fully automated method for noise reduction and robust, standardized traction-force reconstruction. The method, termed Bayesian Fourier transform traction cytometry, combines the robustness of Bayesian L2 regularization with the computation speed of Fourier transform traction cytometry. We validate the performance of the method with synthetic and real data. The method is made freely available as a software package with a graphical user-interface for intuitive usage.

I draw on case studies and new data on state politics to substantially expand our descriptive understanding of the ideological connotations of African American political rights. In contrast to existing literature, this study identifies a transformation in how positions on black suffrage polarized along party lines. It also offers a new interpretation for this racial realignment, presenting evidence that legislators responded less to the electoral consequences of black voting than to efforts of party leaders and social movements to frame its denial as necessary for national unity, a pragmatic accommodation to racist public opinion, or as complicity in slavery and a violation of republicanism. Integrating earlier periods of disenfranchisement and antislavery activism recasts standard party-driven accounts of Reconstruction-era enfranchisements as the culmination of a long process of biracial social movement organizing, enriching our understanding of how both electoral and programmatic concerns contribute to suffrage reforms and of the process by which conflict over citizenship has at times become a central cleavage in American politics.},

The impact of IOs on public support for war has been studied closely by international relations scholars, yet their effects on environmental or human rights issues has not. This is surprising given the extent to which the success of these initiatives will depend upon cooperation through international institutions. This article examines how IOs can influence popular support for two policies aimed at solving global collective action problems: (1) the REDD+ deforestation initiative; and (2) efforts to resettle Syrian refugees. The results presented here use a pair of survey-based experiments to test whether public support for these policies can be affected by the recommendations made by various organizations and their member states. Somewhat surprisingly, the results suggest that endorsements by the United Nations have a greater effect on the US public than do endorsements by organizations known for their technical expertise, or by prominent international NGOs. These findings call into question some of the assumptions we commonly make about the perceived legitimacy of international organizations.},

Yet, the literature on representation is more optimistic: elected officials face strong incentives to listen to voters-not just lobby groups-and this makes for more responsive policies. Building on recent work, we argue a more nuanced point: different types of groups have different effects on responsiveness. We show empirically that lobbying from "cause" groups-representing diffuse interests like climate change-strengthens responsiveness, while lobbying from "sectional" groups-representing industry and professional associations-has no observable effect. Our project uses a novel data set of Canadian lobbying registrations spanning fifteen policy areas from 1990 to 2009. Using a dynamic panel model, we test how interest group lobbying moderates the effect of voter issue attention on government spending. Our findings contribute to contemporary debates over the influence of organized groups, suggesting some interest groups may improve representation.},

This article proposes that when they are part of broader social movements, they can introduce strong age-cohort influences in a movement's development. These influences derive from the balance between youths and adults in a movement and their interrelationships, especially over the long term when demands remain unanswered by the state. Other influences include resource availability, which tends to cluster with older generations, tactical specialization according to age cohorts, and the tendency of groups with younger members to be willing to take greater risks, be more passionate in their demands, and more militant in their tactics. In this report, we identified several empirically recognized cognitive dimensions relevant to youthful participation: (1) identity search, (2) risk taking, (3) emotionality, and (4) cognitive triggering. These cognitive factors of late adolescence and early adulthood can energize a movement when young cohorts participate but also run the risk of alienating older members and public opinion. We discussed how mass movements for political and/or cultural change are frequently intergenerational and how intergenerational relations can mitigate the inward-turning and militant tendencies of young adults. In broad movements for social change, these relations can create a division of labor in which students are the vanguard actors and the older members mobilize the social and material resources available to them. Under other conditions, youth and student groups wield a two-edged sword with the capability of energizing a movement or alienating older cohorts of militants and public opinion.},

Multivariate models with 937 Chilean demonstrations between 2000 and 2012 show that demonstrations are larger when they display more demands (especially universalistic demands), target the national government, attract more organizations (especially umbrella organizations), and mobilize cohesive groups with broad public support.

For most cross-national studies, researchers used either one year's worth of data or multiple years of data but focused exclusively on World Values Survey (WVS) or International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data. The conclusions drawn from these studies are not generalizable because a similar pattern might not occur for other years. The different compositions of the two surveys is also an issue. To fill this gap, we conduct multilevel regression on seven waves of data (4 waves of WVS and 3 waves of ISSP). We complement the existing literature by identifying a number of country-level (economic affluence and economic globalization) and individual-level factors (postmaterialist values, political ideology, trust, income, and education) that have consistent effects on people's willingness to pay higher taxes for the environment across years and surveys. We also identify the effect of interaction variables across levels. This study has policy implications because successful implementation of environmental regulations largely depends on public support. According to the findings we suggest policies that promote economic development and economic globalization; highlight environmentalism and disseminate postmaterialist values; foster trust and social integration; and endorse education to promote one's willingness to make sacrifices for the environment.},

The results show that an increase in experience of paying bribes increases poor people's preference for anti-corruption tactics based on collective action. Furthermore, individuals who perceive corruption to be widespread are significantly more likely to support collective action as their country's poverty level rises. These findings strongly challenge the view recently expressed in some of the literature that high levels of corruption erode the willingness of especially poor Africans to bring corruption under control.},

Drawing on opportunity structure models, Sewell's dual concept of spatial structure and agency, and his concept of event, I analyze how the Occupy activists took over and repurposed Zuccotti Park from a site of consumption and leisure to a space of political claim making.

Given the centrality of prevention to public health science, practice, and law, it would seem that conditions are ripe for the public health law renaissance to expand beyond legal and scientific circles to permeate the general consciousness. Yet, public health law and policy interventions continue to face considerable political and legal opposition. The population perspective which emphasizes the social determinants of health, collective action to create healthier communities, and communitarian rationales for prioritizing health is as important to public health problem-solving as the prevention orientation: But it conflicts with the individualistic orientation that dominates American legal, cultural, and social discourse. This article suggests that public health law and policy debates offer important opportunities for public health advocates to reach across silos to promote the population perspective that unites the field. The article explores contrasting explanations for disease, injury, premature death, and health disparities offered by the population perspective and the individualistic orientation; political and cultural barriers that stand in the way of innovative law and policy interventions; and normative tensions between the communitarian population perspective and self-interested rationales for investment in prevention.},

In Hong Kong, women's activism involving local and migrant domestic workers illuminates points of connection and distance as they are simultaneously privileged and marginalised along the hierarchies of class, ethnicity and nationality. Building on feminist and social movement scholarship, I illustrate how global frames facilitate our understanding of feminist solidarity among local and migrant domestic workers. I argue that the meanings of solidarity that dominate at any particular moment are not stable and enduring, but rather formed out of negotiation and struggle within and across domestic workers' unions.

Drawing on interviews, I document the boundary-making strategies that Mexican-origin Latinos who are anti-illegal immigration deploy to formulate us and them groupings vis-a-vis immigrants. I show that respondents are politically conservative, highly nationalistic, and express a sense of nostalgia for the past in broad terms. They differentiate us from them in terms of national membership, distinguishing those who are deserving of the material and symbolic resources of the nation-state from those who are outsiders. Because they share racial/ethnic markers with immigrants, they engage in boundary-making strategies to split the Latino/Hispanic panethnic category from the Mexican national-origin category, thereby differentiating us (Americans) from them (foreigners). They deploy multicultural discourse that establishes the compatibility of national loyalties and ethnic affinities to reconcile their background with their political position.},

	abstract = {The sociology of collective action has addressed one-sided, nongovernmental anti-minority violence rather infrequently. To explain the preconditions for violence, the "power approach of intergroup hostility" is drawn upon, which entails two processes: the red or imagined threat by an out-group and the identification with an in-group. The conflict dynamic arises out of a change in the balance of power between groups (immigration, economic success, equal rights, symbolic threats). This change has to be translated into a threatening scenario by (mass) communication in which norms change and the target group is gradually delegitimized and "excommunicated" so that violence tends to be regarded as a means of "social control" and as self-help by a group. The "power approach" has to be supplemented with the concept of "frame analysis" and with the theory of social control developed by Donald Black in order to explain the use of pogrom-like violence. Pogroms are defined as entailing three partners: a group of the majority, a targeted minority, and the state. The aggressor regards himself as the legitimate representative of the majority. Pogroms require a specific "opportunity structure" in order to develop in which the behavior of the government, police, public opinion and the bystanders fulfil a key function in the escalation of violence. The excessive violence of pogroms does nor fit easily into the categories of purposeful or symbolic action. Violent actions and potential effects seem to be inseparably linked in such a way that the more violence employed by the mob, the better it can expel, deprave and humiliate its victims.},

Results found that SN website use for policing information was positively related to both support and participation in protests and BLM. Further, in predicting support for protests, this relationship was stronger for individuals who were higher in awareness of oppression and privilege, compared to those who were lower.

	abstract = {Humanity has never benefited more from the ocean as a source of food, livelihoods, and well-being, yet on a global scale this has been accompanied by trajectories of degradation and persistent inequity. Awareness of this has spurred policymakers to develop an expanding network of ocean governance instruments, catalyzed civil society pressure on the public and private sector, and motivated engagement by the general public as consumers and constituents. Among local communities, diverse examples of stewardship have rested on the foundation of care, knowledge and agency. But does an analog for stewardship exist in the context of globally active multinational corporations? Here, we consider the seafood industry and its efforts to navigate this new reality through private governance. We examine paradigmatic events in the history of the sustainable seafood movement, from seafood boycotts in the 1970s through to the emergence of certification measures, benchmarks, and diverse voluntary environmental programs. We note four dimensions of stewardship in which efforts by actors within the seafood industry have aligned with theoretical concepts of stewardship, which we describe as (1) moving beyond compliance, (2) taking a systems perspective, (3) living with uncertainty, and (4) understanding humans as embedded elements of the biosphere. In conclusion, we identify emerging stewardship challenges for the seafood industry and suggest the urgent need to embrace a broader notion of ocean stewardship that extends beyond seafood.},

Public interest groups can use action-type messages as a tool for attracting public attention, thus, alleviating their relative disadvantage in attracting and maintaining members.

In this paper, we study knowledge, beliefs, and behavior related to one such practice during the COVID-19 pandemic ? physical distancing ? using an online survey of social media users in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. We find that, while there is widespread knowledge that physical distancing reduces the spread of the virus, respondents underestimate their peers? support for policies designed to enforce physical distancing, expect others not to practice physical distancing, and do not maintain physical distance themselves. However, more than half of respondents wrote a message to encourage others to practice physical distancing. Findings from survey experiments suggest that making salient the social and material costs for not keeping physical distance were insufficient to encourage compliance, suggestive of the absence of a social norm of physical distancing at the time. Given the large gap between own attitudes and expectations of others? attitudes toward lockdown policies, we propose that providing information on the extent of public support for physical distancing in citizens? own words may encourage compliance in the future.

To test our hypotheses we conducted a content analysis of statements made in eight European news outlets on a sample of 13 policy issues and combined this with Eurobarometer polls. Our results indicate that elected representatives from leftist parties are more congruent with left-wing constituents when civil society mobilizes, while the prevalence of corporate lobby groups strengthens congruence between rightist politicians and their constituents.

We build on an established 21(st)-century framework for how social movements succeed to outline the promising practices of successful social movements. For each of these practices, we identify the consumer psychology mechanisms that motivate collective action and encourage people to transform from bystanders to upstanders, those who provide the grassroots momentum for successful social movements. We illustrate this framework with examples from the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Grievances included unemployment, a lack of basic services, the absence of social justice, and endemic corruption in political and economic institutions. Despite swift and severe state repression, the protest snowballed into a countrywide mobilisation encompassing the central-southern governorates to become the largest protest movement to challenge Iraq's post-2003 political order. By granting analytical weight to the role of early riser activists, this paper focuses on the factors that shaped activists' decisions and lead to different forms of spontaneous participation involving both sympathisers and bystanders. In so doing, it draws attention to the non-hierarchical structure of the movement and its "diffused communication" strategy, the repression as a "moral shock" and the rhetoric of protest slogans. At the crossroads between social movement studies and Iraqi studies, this article contributes to both bodies of scholarship with empirical research. On one hand, it enriches social movement literature by shedding light on strategies and actions adopted by activists operating in non-liberal contexts. On the other hand, it enriches Iraqi political studies by demonstrating that the country hosts a vibrant sphere of contentious politics, a sphere that deserves ample scrutiny.},

We test these expectations by analyzing 314 media claims made by Belgian interest groups regarding 58 policy issues. The results demonstrate that citizen groups with formal members are more prone to share the position of the broader public compared to concentrated interest groups such as business associations, especially if they involve their members in advocacy activities and when issues are salient in the media.},

Using this approach, we go beyond attitudes to assess both individual and contextual predictors of support for gay/lesbian and transgender rights. Using a sample of participants across 77 countries, results revealed that personal gay/lesbian contact (Level-1) and living in a country with more gay/lesbian rights (Level-2) predicted greater support for gay/lesbian rights (n = 71,991). Likewise, transgender contact and living in a country with more transgender rights predicted more support for transgender rights (n = 70,056).

However, no extant scholarship explores how the actions of interest groups affect intergroup relations, even though these organizations represent a variety of social identities. I argue that the decisions of interest group leaders to work together or reject collaboration send signals to everyday members of the identity groups they represent about their relations to other groups. In a survey experiment with a nationally representative sample of African-Americans, I vary whether respondents receive information about a successful coalition or a rejected coalition between African-American interest groups and organizations representing another identity. I find that when African-American interest groups successfully form a coalition with a high-solidarity outgroup (e.g., Hispanics), individuals develop greater feelings of closeness with the outgroup and express greater support for policies that benefit that group. However, when leaders of the outgroup organizations reject the coalition, it creates a backlash effect of lower closeness and weaker policy support. This backlash effect does not occur for low-solidarity outgroups (e.g., atheists). These findings suggest that interest groups are an understudied source of elite influence on identity-based perceptions, which can either promote or obstruct harmonious intergroup relationships.},

Unlike frames and intentional displays, calculated efforts to proclaim authenticity often backfire. We distill two orthogonal types: grassroots (in)authenticity, based on idealized notions of civil society, and institutional (in)authenticity, rooted in culturalcognitive schemas used to judge fit with established SMO categories. Grassroots authenticity benefits an SMO's fundamental legitimacy, while lacking it entirely (i.e., "astroturfing") severely harms public support. Institutional authenticity increases resources and survival chances, intelligibility to elite observers, and clarity of collective identities; still, lacking this (via hybridity) may assist in recruitment and outreach.

We argue that one possible explanation is that cross-cutting cleavages facilitate cross-cutting social interaction among individuals from different ethnic and/or class groups. This article examines whether such cross-cutting interaction, relative to homogeneous interaction, can reduce support for ethnic politics and increase support for a cross-ethnic, programmatic alternative. We conduct an experiment in Lebanon in which 720 lower- and upper-class Christians, Sunnis, and Shia were randomly assigned to participate in discussions that varied in their sectarian and class compositions. Our evidence suggests that cross-sectarian discussion resulted in less support for sectarian politics but only when individuals also belonged to the same economic class, driven by greater learning about shared preferences and reduced coethnic social pressure. We also demonstrate the limitations of other forms of cross-cutting discussion, showing that interaction among coethnics or non-coethnics from different classes did not weaken support for ethnic politics. These findings reveal when and how interaction that leverages a second dimension of interest or identity can help shift political preferences, shedding new light on the foundations of support for cross-ethnic politics in ethnically divided societies.},

Despite characterizations of the opt-out movement as a bunch of "soccer moms" disappointed with their children's test scores, our findings show that opt-out is in fact a structured movement reliant on social movement organizations (SMOs) with agendas that go beyond standardized tests.

	abstract = {There is growing evidence that political economy factors are central to whether or not proposed health financing reforms are adopted, but there is little consensus about which political and institutional factors determine the fate of reform proposals. One set of scholars see the relative strength of interest groups in favour of and opposed to reform as the determining factor. An alternative literature identifies aspects of a country's political institutions-specifically the number and strength of formal 'veto gates' in the political decision-making process-as a key predictor of reform's prospects. A third group of scholars highlight path dependence and 'policy feedback' effects, stressing that the sequence in which health policies are implemented determines the set of feasible reform paths, since successive policy regimes bring into existence patterns of public opinion and interest group mobilization which can lock in the status quo. We examine these theories in the context of Malaysia, a successful health system which has experienced several instances of proposed, but ultimately blocked, health financing reforms. We argue that policy feedback effects on public opinion were the most important factor inhibiting changes to Malaysia's health financing system. Interest group opposition was a closely related factor; this opposition was particularly powerful because political leaders perceived that it had strong public support. Institutional veto gates, by contrast, played a minimal role in preventing health financing reform in Malaysia. Malaysia's dramatic early success at achieving near-universal access to public sector healthcare at low cost created public opinion resistant to any change which could threaten the status quo. We conclude by analysing the implications of these dynamics for future attempts at health financing reform in Malaysia.},

Strong explanation for expressive support outcomes (commenting, 'liking,' 'sharing') between both groups, 90.1\% (supporters of LGBTQ) and 74.9\% (non-supporters of LGBTQ), was retrieved. Group identification is a robust mediator of issue involvement, predicting expressive support irrespective of users' attitude toward the issue. Perceived participative efficacy is the strongest predictor of support expression, but, like perceived self-network opinion congruity, vary between users with different issue attitudes and involvement. Findings suggest an intricate social media-based micromobilization process that needs to consider issue-group positions and counter-group dynamics.},

It starts with findings from psychology showing that people are intuitive thinkers whose decisions result less from rational calculation than from symbolic predispositions-biases such as ideology and prejudice. Studies also show that increased feelings of threat lead to increased aggressive attitudes and behavior. Symbolic politics theory explains how individual attitudes can result in collective action using mobilization theory, with social organization and framing by leaders explaining which attitudes become political action. According to symbolist logic, important causes of war include aggressive symbolic predispositions among leaders or mass publics, heightened threat perceptions, and strong political organizations backing aggressive leaders. Crises and enduring rivalries make war more likely because they strengthen hostile predispositions and threat perceptions, thereby promoting mobilization for war. Cooperative transnational ties and democratic political institutions are among the factors that tend to promote peace.},

The existing literature generally applies the principle of deliberation to evaluate social movements, but few studies have examined the corresponding practice of deliberative democracy within a movement. The Occupy Central (OCLP) campaign in Hong Kong is a rare case in which the organizers incorporated Deliberation Days into a social movement; however, participant self-selection turned it into an instance of 'enclave deliberation'. This paper studies the impact of enclave deliberation on social movements based on the case of the OCLP campaign and argues that enclave deliberation can be a powerful tool for mobilization, particularly for gaining public support and for recruiting core participants. However, the coherence and support of the movement can decline when enclave deliberation is used to make decisions for the general public, because enclave deliberation incorporates only a small spectrum of like-minded participants who might not seriously engage with opposing views. The findings of this study imply that enclave deliberation could facilitate mobilization, but it has its inherent limitations for decision-making in a movement. Given the selective nature of social movements, deliberation within social movements is likely to be enclave deliberation in most cases. This study thus has significant implications for the practice of deliberation in social movements in other contexts.},

What brings groups into social and political conflict with each other, and what may instead drive them to cooperate or become allies? This paper presents evidence from a nationally representative non-probability survey, finding that groups' perceived values-that is, their general beliefs about what is right or desirable-relate to a broad array of intergroup relationships. Individuals who perceive racial, religious, and partisan outgroup members as supporting self-transcendence values (those related to care, cooperation and other prosocial behaviors) express more positive affect, solidarity, willingness to engage in political action, and tolerance with respect to those groups. The magnitude of this association exceeds those of other perceived basic and political values, even when it comes to explicitly political attitudes or target groups. Thus, fundamental, ostensibly nonpolitical beliefs about outgroups' prosocial intentions may underlie intergroup conflict and cooperation.},

Furthermore, within the confines of the declining casualty tolerance, two variables cumulatively determine the actors' choice of discourse: the level of enforcement of recruitment, ranging from conscription to voluntary recruitment, and the social position of the group to which the agents belong. Given that conscription brings powerful, high-status groups into the ranks who may be unwilling to make sacrifices for war, subversive responses are more likely to occur in conscript militaries than in volunteer forces and vice versa.

The Video Volunteers and CGNET Swara are two citizen journalism organizations that work in Central India, in areas whose human and development indexes are among the lowest in the country. Citizen journalism has been studied both as a consequence and as an instigator of social revolution. The Arab Spring movement and the case of Mohamed Bouazizi in the 2010 Tunisian uprisings are prominent recent examples. But citizen journalism in these and similar cases usually focus on the framing of martyr narratives where individuals and their protests or reactions against human rights atrocities make them "a symbol of the struggle for justice, dignity and freedom." Through a content analysis of 400 news stories posted in the year 2015-2016 and qualitative interviews with 30 participants and a focus group of 15 participants, this study analyses how the Video Volunteers and CGNET Swara train citizens to produce news, the kinds of frame that are used to mobilize audiences, and encourage them to articulate outrage against the many human rights atrocities that occur in these areas. Findings show that citizen journalism succeeds because of the culturally resonant frames used and effective frame alignment that resonate with their main audiences and producers. The news produced and disseminated activates connective structures to facilitate collective action among audiences and communities who earlier had little means or recourse to address such issues. This collective action encourages participants to gather offline to fight for their demands and positively transform their communities.},

During the first mobilization stage, the stakeholders provided material incentives to the bystanders. During the second stage, activists appealed to the bystanders' perception of extraordinary injustice related to the triggering event and the local society as a whole.

HKTV's David vs Goliath struggle against the decision demonstrated how political fear (of Beijing control over the Hong Kong government) among the people has fed into an anxiety over media monopoly. What might have caught the powers-to-be by surprise was the vociferous protest from the general public. My analysis situates the incident in the context of an array of travesties against media freedoms in recent years, which have enabled the audience (as citizens) to rise up and demand their cultural rights to creative and quality TV. I conclude by examining the agency of creativity, which, in this case, has been articulated to an agency of (decolonized) identity in the struggle for democracy in the present political cultural conjuncture of Hong Kong.},

A series of simulation experiments and statistical analyses are conducted. Results show that LOH has an inverse U-shape effect on the likelihood of participation (whether an individual decides to participate). By contrast, the findings reveal that LOH has a monotonous effect on participation timing (when a participant makes the decision). Specifically, when LOH is high, an individual opts to participate early. These observations can be explained by the influence of LOH on the structure of social networks and by the moderating effect of the global distribution of opinions within the population.},

	abstract = {The present article examines differentiation and specialization of the national educational ideology on the ground of one of its most politicized component that until now has not been the object of a special study. The author tries to give an overview of the development in standpoints of the Estonian national leaders in the realm of rule and direction of the folk (in the first place peasant) school, tracing the relation between the negative and constructive side of this matter. From the 1830s the Estonian peasant school had been administrated by the Consistories of the Lutheran Church and the Baltic Knightages with the help of their provincial school institutions. The struggle to provide the Estonian communities and educated persons with access to supervision of the folk school began from the beginning of the Estonian national movement (in the 1860s). We can see the development from indistinct, unrealistic proposals and na ve hope on benevolence of the Russian government (tsar) to more self-confidence and significant demands. The memorandum of Estonian village communities (1864) declared that the Estonian peasant schools should be administrated by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Empire. Actually this request stood for the elimination of the unequal and estate provincial school administration. However, no constructive proposal had been added. In the next essential memorandum to the Russian government in 1881, which reflected the views of the radical and somewhat Russophile wing of the national movement led by Carl Robert Jakobson, a newspaper editor, the central political proposal was for the reform of the provincial self-government with an equal representation for the Estonians with the Baltic Germans and the unification of the areas populated by Estonians into one administrative unit (national province). As to peasant education, the Estonian leaders demanded there only the abolition of the Baltic German control and inspection, the Ministry of Education was not even mentioned. This memorandum reflects hesitation with regard to Russian educational institutions. Hypothetically we can suppose that the radical national leaders had connected the problems of school administration with the prospective Estonian national self-government. The Russificatory reforms in the 1880s and the introduction of Russian as the language of instruction in all types of schools were a serious disappointment to the Estonian public opinion. Estonians did not receive the slightest opportunity to participate in school administration. The Revolution of 1905 stimulated the rise of political activity and pluralism. The Estonian liberal and socialist parties and movements disclosed their programmes, which included democratic, at times ultra-democratic requirements also in the sphere of school administration. The author attempts to discuss the problems from the point of view of the level of maturity of Estonian society for the national territorial and administrative autonomy within the Russian Empire and draws a conclusion that although speaking about autonomy and independence in the sphere of education the Estonian leaders nevertheless frequently laid too much hope on the financial support from the Russian government and gave up too much of authority to the state administration. In 1911 Peeter P o ld, who was to become the first Minister of Education for the Republic of Estonia (1918) and the first professor of education at Tartu University (1920 -1930), published the first comprehensive project of subordination, guidance and control of local schools in Estonia, in which he attached great importance to the lower levels of guidance and control (village communities and parishes). In that way P o ld hoped to more successfully protect the national school keeping in view the continuing pressure of forcible Russification.},

	abstract = {Perlo's engagement with the complex and ambiguous relationship between Marxism (and, more broadly, the socialist traditions) and the moral status of animals is very much to be welcomed. This sort of engagement is valuable for three main reasons. First, the more narrowly focused social movement activity-whether committed to animal rights, social justice in the workplace, or advancement for women-is liable to cut itself off from critical insights created in the context of other movements. I became aware of this, particularly during the 1980s in relation to radical green politics, as both deepening and widening the already existing socialist case against neo-liberal capitalism, just as the women's liberation movement had done a decade or more earlier Second, this sort of analysis is valuable because without it "single-issue" movements run a serious risk of advancing the claims of their own preferred social group at the cost of (usually unknowingly and unintentionally) deepening the oppression or exploitation of other groups. Third, where radical social movements campaign for changes that conflict with the interests of wealthy and powerful interests, and are committed to democratic values, they need to be able to bring public opinion with them. Single-issue movements rarely can do this on their own: Broad-based coalitions are needed. Moreover, the sources of radical thought and the range of justified grievances are now so diverse that the notion of a single, unified political party as the centralized vehicle of change is no longer viable (if it ever was). So, the broadly based coalition has to be diverse and difference-respecting. But can it be this while still maintaining enough unity of purpose and coordination of its actions to be effective?},

Although the literature on the repression-dissent nexus has primarily focused on whether repression effectively deters dissenting behavior, a limitation is that researchers do not often distinguish between behavior and preferences. One possible implication is that although the observable protest behavior can be reduced by repression, underlying opposition demands may remain intact or even be strengthened. Hence, the question of why repression should alter public preferences remains theoretically under-investigated, because there is limited micro-level evidence that captures changes in opposition preferences induced by a repressive episode. We fielded comparable conjoint experiments before and after the enactment of the Hong Kong National Security Law in June 2020. Support for the demands was largely stable despite the sweeping powers of the law to curb protests, although some moderation of demands was observed. We outline avenues for future research on mechanisms and implications entailed by the effects of repression on preferences.},

By analyzing the data collected from onsite protest surveys in December 2019 and January 2020 (N = 1,784), this paper presents the mediating role of guilt in shifting senior citizens from opposing radical actions to supporting them and feeling solidarity with militant protesters. We find that the relationship between age and feelings of guilt is stronger among respondents who experience state repression.

	abstract = {In order to reach climate goals, governments need to gain support from their voters for the necessary policy interventions, such as carbon dioxide taxes. Previous research concludes that people often do not support and legitimize such taxes because they perceive them as unfair. However, the notion of fairness implies a multitude of factors and despite attempts of the previous research to further nuance people's fairness perceptions, we currently lack a more precise understanding of what people mean when they regard carbon taxes as unfair. In this article, we thoroughly investigate this problem by using original survey data from YouGov collected in the United States in 2018 and analyzing open-ended survey responses on why people think carbon taxes are unfair. Applying structural topic modeling, we unpack the multi-dimensional meaning of unfairness, as perceived by the US population. The results from our analysis show that people regard carbon taxes based on gas pricing as unfair because they perceive gas prices already being high, because of the need to drive, unfairness for the poor or rural population, lack of trust in government, or considerations that the purpose of the tax is unjustified. These findings help provide a more nuanced policy design to address fairness concerns related to carbon taxes.},

Three different data sets are used in this study: road crash and traffic violation data from Qatar, and two separate questionnaire surveys (from general public and road safety experts). Results showed that during COVID-19 period, the total number of crashes in Qatar significantly reduced during the pandemic compared with the previous 5 years. However, the rates of serious and fatal injuries significantly increased. Regarding the general public perceptions, more than 80\% reported that roads became safer while driving behaviours improved during the pandemic. On the other hand, more than 50\% of the experts disagreed that roads became safer, 55\% disagreed that driving behaviours improved and 70\% agreed that less attention from governments was directed toward road safety during the pandemic. The findings from this study could help policy makers to understand the road safety status during the pandemic to make appropriate adjustments in the traffic laws and regulations on a temporary basis. This could help in reducing crash-related injuries and as a result reduce pressure on health and other emergency services.},

More specifically, we argue that, because honor and reputation are socially situated values, they are most salient in the presence of others (i.e., co-offenders). Method: We merged incident-level data from 1,881,802 violent incidents in the National Incident-Based Reporting System for 2015-2016 with contextual data from the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for 1,679 counties within 38 states. We conducted multilevel models examining the relationship between co-offending group size, the presence of a firearm. regional context, and serious injury among assault offenses. Results: Findings reveal that firearms are more likely to be present as the number of offenders increases and more likely to be present in the Confederate South than in other regions. Further, the risk of serious injury increases as group size increases and is greater when a firearm is present. Finally, and most importantly, regional context moderates the influence of co-offending group size and the presence of a firearm on serious injury. Specifically, incidents committed by larger groups, with firearms, in the Confederate South result in particularly high rates of serious injury. Conclusions: Given the way firearms and group size interact to influence violence in the Confederate South. we suggest that research on Southern violence would benefit from a reorientation that considers the important theoretical role that bystanders and accomplices might play within a culture of honor.},

First, we find that industry scandals differentially affect contentious and collaborative SMOs' ability to mobilize resources. SMOs that had collaborated with the oil and gas industry before the spill suffered from reduced public support after the spill, and those that had contentiously interacted with the industry enjoyed increased contributions. Second, we find that industry scandals affect SMOs' willingness to collaborate with firms in the future. We show that the Horizon oil spill produced a broad chilling effect on environmental SMOs' collaborations with firms both within and outside of the oil and gas industry. Our findings show that there are risks inherent to a collaborative strategy that cannot be fully mitigated.

	abstract = {In the early days of social media, social scientists speculated that it could support democracy because large media conglomerates could not dominate it. Regarding climate change, research documents the influence of the fossil fuel industry in climate denial discourses in the traditional media. Therefore, a similar hope emerged that a more democratized platform would see less polarization in belief about climate change's scientific basis. However, online public opinion about climate change continues to be extremely polarized, and the social forces behind it are not well understood. Here, we examine the role of one proposed mechanism for the systemic polarization and spread of disinformation in online discourses - the automated social media bot. This article pioneers the use of bot detection software on climate change discussion on Twitter, using automated monitoring of 6.8 million tweets. We examine the period around the time of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on June 1, 2017. We find that the announcement generated an immediate online social movement response with very low suspected bot presence. Prior to and afterwards, however, suspected bots were responsible for approximately 25\% of original tweets. Additionally, we find that suspected bots were more frequent in some topic areas than others, including denialist discourses focused on research questioning the reality or importance of climate change. Key policy insights On an average day during our study period, automated bots produced an estimated one-quarter of all original tweets referencing climate change and global warming. Bots were more active in some discussion areas than others - including climate denialist messages. President Trump's announcement of the U.S.'s planned withdrawal from the Paris Agreement generated an immediate online social movement response with very low suspected bot presence. For social media to deliver on its promise of a decentralized and democratic forum, automated accounts need to be identified, marginalized, and removed.},

Results: Data showed that interveners were rarely physically harmed-at a rate of 3.6\%-and noninterveners were virtually never victimized. Confirmatory regression results showed that conflict party affiliation was a moderately robust predictor of bystander victimization. The gender of the intervener was a highly fragile risk factor.

Conceptualizing monitors as agenda-builders, I contend that their potential impacts rely on two factors neglected by previous studies: access to the public's agenda, and access to policymakers. I test the impact of election monitoring on electoral integrity using cross-national time-series data of all democratic backsliding and revival episodes in Asia from 1950 to 2018. I find that domestic monitors do have more than a placebo effect, but that their capacities to immunize against democratic regression are modest at best. When neither access to the public's agenda nor access to policymakers are present, monitors are unlikely to halt backsliding. However, public attention becomes an effective resource where groups have policy access. This adds to studies of democratic backsliding, election monitoring, and interest groups.},

The introduction of digital technologies, however, has diversified this discursive environment and seemed to reverse the uneven dynamics. Using a case study of a protest campaign organized by Chinese American immigrants, this study demonstrates a new pattern of movement-media/public dynamics that goes beyond the "asymmetric dependency" model or its obverse. In the aftermath of a Chinese American police officer who shot a black man to death, Chinese immigrants stood with him and deliberated on WeChat, a China-based digital platform engineered like a "walled garden." The technolinguistic enclosure of the platform facilitated the development of a separate interpretative universe in the WeChatsphere vis-a-vis the one in the mediasphere. Later, even when immigrant protesters confronted the public in the Twittersphere, they continued talking past each other. By unpacking the decoupling processes between movements and the media/public, this study shifts the research focus from understanding their interaction to examining their disengagement, as well as the "filter bubble" effects that contribute to contemporary fragmentation and polarization in political and civic engagements.},

To our knowledge, no study compares them in a single sample. We used a national Internet sample to examine the measures' predictive powers in explaining a range of environmental behaviors. Connectedness to Nature and environmentalist identity were the strongest predictors of pro-environmental behavior in our sample, and our findings also suggested a difference in private versus public behaviors.

Due to the continual interactions between affected groups and the corresponding government responses surrounding the public interests related to health, online public opinion structure reversal arises frequently in NIMBY conflict events, which pose a serious threat to social public security. To explore the underlying mechanism, this paper introduces an improved dynamic model which considers multiple heterogeneities in health concerns and social power of individuals and in government's ability. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model can provide an accurate description of the entire process of online public opinion structure reversal in NIMBY conflict environmental mass incidents on the Internet. In particular, the proportion of the individual agents without health interest appeals will delay the online public opinion structure reversal, and the upper threshold remains within regulatory limits from 0.4 to 0.5. Unlike some previous results that show that the guiding powers of the opinion leaders varied over its ratio in a fixed-sized group, our results suggest that the impact of opinion leaders is of no significant difference for the time of structure reversal after it increased to about 6\%. Furthermore, a double threshold effect of online structure reversal during the government's response process was observed. The findings are beneficial for understanding and explaining the process of online public opinion structure reversal in NIMBY conflict environmental mass incidents, and provides theoretical and practical implications for guiding public or personal health opinions on the Internet and for a governments' effective response to them.},

From the 1970s through the early 2000s, the practice of measuring environmental attitudes was dominated by the New Environmental Paradigm (NEP) Scale, which assesses only a narrow dimension of environmental thought. While the NEP remains in use, especially internationally, other scales have since been introduced in part to make up for its methodological and theoretical issues. Survey research has also evolved since the time the NEP was debuted, employing increasingly sophisticated technologies and mixed methodologies. Of what use are NEP-type attitude surveys in the context of contemporary environmental thought and politics? This paper chronicles the history of the quantification of environmentalism, focusing on the NEP and discussing its merits and drawbacks. It proceeds to evaluate alternative metrics, paying special attention to the social context in which they emerged. It concludes by offering ways in which researchers can embrace the fluidity of environmental concern, and think creatively more about what methodologies they might employ to capture it in the future.},

	abstract = {China has witnessed unprecedented and rapid urbanization which has led to the depopulation and structural collapse of many traditional rural village communities, and the decline of many collective functions such as the effective management of the public realm. In seeking to address this problem it is clear from the literature that there is considerable potential in catalyzing collective action, particularly where there is a moral imperative to act and the availability of leaders with the ability to organize the collective. However, while there is evidence that community-based collective action has provided effective localized solution pathways for managing collective goods when the focus has been on the distribution of benefits, there is little evidence about its potential in scenarios associated with the distribution of costs, or responsibilities. In addressing this asymmetry, we present a case study of a typical village near Shanghai which has successfully established a community based environmental management system, and describe the process, characteristics and influencing factors of its responsibility-centered collective action. Our findings show that smart local leadership, an effective organizing strategy, and involvement of a suitable 'core group' was crucial. The strategy of mobilizing this core group, of empowering them with decision-making rights, and supporting their volunteered role as a 'bridge and platform' connecting the village cadres and villagers, significantly reduced the enforcement and monitoring costs, controlled free rider problems, and gained public support and participation, leading to a stable and sustainable solution. Our findings illustrate specific principles that apply to many cases in China, and general principles that are likely to be applicable more widely.},

The article shows that when regulatory forbearance caused stasis, and the "statist", exclusionary policymaking context limited consumer groups' access to the policymaking process, consumer groups challenged the policy regime of the banking sector and the regulator by appealing to another state actor, the Ministry of Customs and Trade. The Ministry took advantage of an opportunity structure to pass a new consumer protection law which assigned a de facto mandate on the regulatory agency to regulate fees, commissions, and charges. The article argues that the regulatory policy change was a product of a policy regime change with the Ministry emerging as a veto player, as it redefined the institutional arrangements in the policymaking process, and imposed its preferences and its stricter policy approach. As such, the article contributes to our understanding of the conditions of how diffuse interest groups can trigger regulatory policy change, but more importantly policy regime change.},

These organizations address global challenges and help overcome collective action problems, but public opposition can severely curb their effectiveness. Yet, we do not know whether the public supports such organizations and perceives them as legitimate. This article draws on diverse political science literatures to outline why a focus on public opinion is important. The article tests two competing arguments explaining potential opposition toward organizations like the ISO and the FSC: accounts centered on the role of sincere preferences over the legitimate locus of authority and on the influence of domestic elite rhetoric. Results suggest that public opinion is generally positive and that elite rhetoric about a potential democratic deficit rather than simple information about the bodies' governance structures decreases favorability.},

An experiment embedded in a survey of a representative sample of the US public shows that citizens are influenced less by the extent of material contributions from other countries than by whether the United Nations sanctions the mission. Further analysis indicates that the United Nations functions as a legitimating device that can help overcome collective action problems, rather than through alternative approaches emphasizing the signaling of information or ensuring greater military resources.

	abstract = {Since the argumentative turn in EU studies, research has shown that civil society activists can challenge frames promoted by EU institutions and incumbent groups, and influence public opinion in the EU. However, most studies of civil society mobilisation on EU issues have focused on the vertical framing of issues from Brussels to national capitals, rarely analysing mobilisation beyond Brussels. This article builds upon ongoing research on Spanish civil society activism on the TTIP (Bouza \& Oleart, 2018) and framing EU issues on Twitter (Bouza \& Tunon, 2018), contributing to the study of the role of national activists in the horizontal translation of EU-wide mobilisation to national publics. We argue that national actors play an influential role in the discursive struggle to define 'Europe' and the EU in the (national) public spheres (Diez Medrano, 2003). Building on our previous analysis of national activism on TTIP in Spain, we analyse whether activists have engaged in a process of frame bridging (Snow et al., 1986), in order to expand the mobilisation against TTIP towards new issues and constituencies relating to the broader trade strategy of the EU. The present research addresses the role of the Spanish anti- TTIP social movement in the emergence, circulation and bridging of critical frames on the TTIP negotiations in the Spanish Twitter sphere. The article combines quantitative and qualitative methods -network analysis and framing analysis- in order to analyse the role of the @NoAlTTIP network in the building and diffusion of frames challenging the EU institutions discourse on trade in the Spanish context.},

Using the policy examples of employment nondiscrimination and same-sex couple adoption, the present study identifies, measures, and assesses several values that add to the very short list previously used to explain public opinion about gay rights issues. Content from interest-group Web sites and news media coverage of the two issues aided in identifying the values. Data from an original Internet survey yield valid measures of the values. Multivariate analyses indicate that the values behave in predictable ways: they are strongly influenced by partisanship, and they strongly affect opinions about the two issues. The performance of the values is consistent with findings from previous research on the partisan basis of values and the value-based nature of opinions. The article concludes with suggestions for further empirical and theoretical work that could apply and extend the concept of issue-relevant values.},

The authors argue that this lack of interest in exploiting the revolution in political rhetoric could be due to an anti-revolution consensus, i.e. a situation in which most Russians openly oppose a revolution as a possible future scenario for their country, even though they differ widely in how they evaluate the revolution of 1917. Apart from politicians, this also had a great impact on other actors such as writers, film directors, and social movement activists.

But two dilemmas plague framing efforts directed at state agents such as police officers, who are seen as potential violators of rights. First, these actors may be less likely than members of the general public to share the beliefs in terms of which human rights workers frame rights; and second, frames by their very nature simplify reality, and fail to take into account factors that constrain state agents' actions. This article explores these issues through a case study of human rights education involving police officers in India. Educators may be able to mitigate such obstacles by basing their framing efforts on research on the specific populations with which they are working, and using frames as only one part of an approach that takes into account the limited ability of frames to encompass all aspects of the situations in which violations occur.},

This paper scrutinizes two of the core assumptions of this debate: that insider and outsider organizers operate differently on union recognition campaigns, and that workers respond to them differently in these settings. We analyzed 153 in-depth interviews with workers and organizers conducted at the height of the debate, in order to answer two questions: What is the role of outsider organizers during private sector union recognition campaigns, and how do outsider organizers secure workers' consent in these settings? All of the organizers in our data-set were graduates of the AFL-CIO's Organizing Institute, and 64 of them were outsiders. The outsider organizers in our data-set confronted barriers that insider organizers did not, including workers' concerns about their youth, inexperience and lack of professionalism, and their own inability to relate to workers. While many critics of outsider organizers claim that these barriers are insurmountable, we found the opposite to be true. The vast majority of outsider organizers in our data-set successfully secured workers' consent by demonstrating commitment, building relationships, and being honest and forthright. After proposing changes in organizer training and leadership development in response to these findings, we conclude with a brief discussion of the enduring debate about outsiders' role in social protest in the U.S.},

Social movements can play a key role in deploying, framing, and in some cases, producing, cognitive shocks that affect public opinion and political advocacy. Three case studies of scientific cognitive shocks illuminate the interplay between social movements and science and the resulting effects on attitudes and activism: studies finding that smoking cigarettes and exposure to secondhand smoke have harmful health effects, studies suggesting that sexual orientation has a biological basis, and scientific evidence for cetacean intelligence. Cognitive shocks emphasize how compelling shifts in conceptual and logical perceptions can act as powerful motivators of activism and, by doing so, complement existing work done in social movement literature on the role of emotions in mobilization. It is likely that a combination of emotional and rational motivators sustain activism, and a more thorough understanding of how both of these processes affect mobilization can serve to better elucidate the mechanisms underlying opinions toward, and action taken for, social change.},

Social lobbying influences public officials because the social environment allows for greater receptivity to interest group messages. A randomized field experiment was conducted by a lobbying firm in a US state legislature. Legislators randomly assigned to be socially lobbied more frequently expressed public support for the interest group's preferred policy than did legislators lobbied in their offices or not contacted by the lobbyist. In addition, an original survey of registered lobbyists was conducted in 10 US states demonstrating that social lobbying regularly occurs. Political elites are influenced by the social environment; interest group direct lobbying is influential when conducted in places not easily observed by the public.},

As more researchers from different backgrounds enter the field, the study of nanoswimmers offers new opportunities but also significant experimental and theoretical challenges. In particular, the accurate characterization of nanoswimmers is often hindered by strong Brownian motion, convective effects, and the lack of a clear way to visualize them. When coupled with improper experimental designs and imprecise practices in data analysis, these issues can translate to results and conclusions that are inconsistent and poorly reproducible. This Perspective follows the course of a typical nanoswimmer investigation from synthesis through to applications and offers suggestions for best practices in reporting experimental details, recording videos, plotting trajectories, calculating and analyzing mobility, eliminating drift, and performing control experiments, in order to improve the reliability of the reported results.},

To ensure that the relationship is causal, we use an instrumental variable strategy, which exploits the exogenous assignment of Catholic "spy priests" to local communities. To trace the underlying mechanisms, we draw on qualitative interviews and archival sources. We document that Poland's comprehensive use of surveillance created widespread anger as well as an incentive for citizens to reveal their true loyalties, thus facilitating antiregime collective action.

Here, we tested the impact on helping behavior of the affiliation of the bystanders with respect to the participants. We recruited 40 male supporters of the U.K. Arsenal football club for a two-factor between groups study with 10 participants per group. Each participant spoke with a virtual human Arsenal supporter (V), the scenario displayed in a virtual reality system. During this conversation, another virtual character (P), not an Arsenal fan, verbally abused V for being an Arsenal fan leading eventually to physical pushing. There was a group of three virtual bystanders who were all either Arsenal supporters indicated by their shirts, or football fans wearing unbranded shirts. These bystanders either encouraged the participant to intervene or dissuaded him. We recorded the number of times that participants intervened to help V during the aggression. We found that participants were more likely to intervene when the bystanders were out-group with respect to the participant. By comparing levels of intervention with a "baseline" study (identical except for the presence of bystanders), we conclude that the presence of in-group bystanders decreases helping. We argue therefore that, other things being equal, diffusion of responsibility is more likely to be overcome when participant and victim share group membership, but bystanders do not. Our findings help to develop understanding of how diffusion of responsibility works by combining elements of both the bystander effect and the social identity approach to bystander behavior.},

I argue that legislators invite interest groups to participate in the legislative process to raise the salience of issues they "own". Legislators with gatekeeping authority, I show, bring interest groups into committees when their party benefits from raising public attention. Interest groups, on their part, are given preferential access to finetune laws that directly affect them. Extensions of the model show that participation increases before an election and declines after, with issue salience providing electoral benefits rather than policy ones. I test my argument using an original dataset of 4902 instances of interest group participation in committee meetings in the Ecuadorian Congress between 1988 and 2018, as well as over 30 interviews to interest group representatives, legislators, and congressional staff.},

Drawing on news accounts, government records, public opinion polls, and organizational-capacity data for twenty-six gun control and twenty-nine gun rights groups, we show that both sides grow during policy fights and after focusing events, but the side with more stable revenue sustains growth longer. The gun rights movement's financial advantages made it far less dependent on attention-grabbing moments. This imbalance reflects resource differences that affect each side's capacity for responding to political opportunities and threats.

Source-related predispositions, such as credibility assessments, are therefore less relevant in moderating effects of persuasive appeals by interest groups than those of high-profile communicators. We test this argument in multiple large-scale studies. A parallel survey and field experiment (N=4,659) establishes the persuasive potential of low-profile interest groups in both controlled and realistic settings. An observational study (N=700) shows that substantial portions of the public are unable to assess interest group credibility.

Building on this specific climate litigation case, the present article analyzes the strategy formation of new actors in the field of climate governance. Based on existing concepts of social movement research, the strategy formation of the KlimaSeniorinnen is reconstructed in terms of a strategic actor who pursues certain strategic orientations in given strategic contexts. The empirical analysis of the strategic context (by means of opportunity structures), the strategic orientations (via collective action frames), and the strategic actor (by means of interviews) shows a double strategy. On the one hand, the KlimaSeniorinnen attempt to address a specific legal opportunity structure with an `injustice frame,' which emphasizes human rights and the special vulnerability of older women to intense heat waves. On the other hand, they want to mobilize public support for an ambitious climate policy by additionally promoting a `grandchildren frame,' which articulates altruistic values, such as responsibility towards future generations. Based on this analysis, both practical implications and consequences for future research on a new climate politics, which is increasingly taking shape between and across different arenas, are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Karamat Watan (March of Dignity) was the largest protest mobilisation in Kuwaiti history. From late December 2011 to 2014 this social movement pressured the government in the streets to reform the parliamentary system. The results of these protests were unprecedented, forcing a Kuwaiti prime minister to resign for the first time in in history and publicly challenging against the country's ruler. Yet the protest movement largely failed, largely due to a loss of public support. Why did the Karamat Watan protest movement lose support from the public in Kuwait? The literature on the Gulf and Kuwait in particular focus on payoffs as a way of explaining acquiesance, yet payoffs in 2011 and 2012 had almost no impact on protest mobilisation. Instead, it may be more normative issues that kept protesters away: the unrealistic and aggressive demands of protest organisers for regime change. This article focuses on the legitimacy, or lackthereof, of the government and regime to explain the failure of the "Arab Spring" protest movement in Kuwait, looking at how consent and normative concerns impacted the decision of protesters to leave the streets. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with citizens who participated in the protests, interviews with dozens of members of the opposition leadership, and group surveys at 13 tribal diwaniyas that highlight a cross-section of protesters' opinion. The research presented demonstrates that public support for the social movement may have in part failed largely because the movement was unsuccessful in framing that it could govern if it was successful. Public support was also limited by protest tactics including disrupting modes of transportation and livelihood. At the heart of protesters' concerns was the lack of a substantive opposition they could believe in and poor opinions on the quality of leadership in Karamat Watan. This article fills a gap in the literature by developing a clearer understanding of legitimation in a rentier state, Kuwait, and by providing dense empirical data to back it up. The utility of this approach is important considering that the failure for many social movements to frame grievances in a way that mobilizes the population, a common pattern in the region.},

Our study also explores various organizational incentives advocacy groups use to maintain support. We gather data from structured interviews of advocacy organizations in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. Our findings suggest that many local advocacy groups did receive enhanced public support in the forms of volunteer requests, donations, and membership immediately after the election and the majority of them were able to retain the support over time.

	abstract = {Climate change is an ever-growing problem that requires a network of policy solutions. There exists variation in state-level responses to climate change, firmly placing it within the context of state-level representation. There are various explanations for policy outcomes at the state level, including public opinion, institutional control, interest group activity, among others. With respect to climate change, another potential explanation provided by scholars for the variation in policy responses is the degree of risk posed by climate change to a particular state. However, climate change serves as a somewhat unique policy position as it is highly visible and has been a polarizing issue in American political discourse. This paper analyzes how risk, political control, and opinion affect policy responses to climate change. Employing multiple measures for state-level action on climate change as well as state-level opinion on the existence and perceived threat of climate change, this analysis theorizes that given the polarized nature of the climate change debate in the United States, public opinion on the realities of climate change and partisan control of state government influences policy outcomes more so than any level of quantified threat from climate change. The causal reasoning for this dual effect is the impact of citizen demands and overarching party ideologies. Even when controlling for wealth, energy industry activity, and political lobbying within states, findings indicate a strong relationship between citizen opinion and partisan control on state-level action on climate change, posing a challenge for combatting long-term impacts of climate change.},

This paper describes an educational intervention aimed at increasing positive attitudes and actions to support Muslim Australians. University students participated in a 12-week educational programme that drew on prejudice reduction principles and a pedagogical approach that emphasised active discussion. Results (N = 94) showed an increase in positivity towards Muslim people, increased intention to take bystander action to confront prejudice, and social identification (as a supporter of positive relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Australians). Boosts in positivity towards Muslim people and intention to confront prejudice were mediated by increases in social identity, although changes in social identification only explained increased commitment to confront prejudice in a low risk scenario. Results suggest that educational interventions such as these can foster new, inclusive identities that provide a basis for action to support Muslim people.},

Community services districts (CSDs) in California, a class of special districts that provides various neighborhood-level services, are examined to answer this question. An innovative characteristic of this institutional form is that it is residents who create them through a grass-root collective action to achieve a bottom-up governance structure, after opting out from a county service system. With changes in residential property values as performance metrics, the quantitative analysis utilizes district formation events and features a hedonic difference-in-difference regression. The results show that the creation of CSDs produces more significant impacts on property values than county authorities do. Yet, the effects are heterogeneous across the communities when the analysis is further drilled down to each district. The exploratory qualitative case study then uses interview data with district managers and document analysis to unveil what administrative factors explain the success and failure trajectory of bottom-up institution management. The case study identifies such factors as critical codeterminants, including managerial and board leadership, clarity of a problem statement, public support, and intergovernmental coordination with county and state agencies.},

Unfortunately, many populations-from undocumented migrants to right-wing activists and oligarchs-are hidden, lack sampling frames, or are otherwise hard to survey. An approach to hard-to-survey populations commonly taken by researchers in other disciplines is largely missing from the toolbox of political science methods: respondent-driven sampling (RDS). By leveraging relations of trust, RDS accesses hard-to-survey populations; it also promotes representativeness, systematizes data collection, and, notably, supports population inference. In approximating probability sampling, RDS makes strong assumptions. Yet if strengthened by an integrative multimethod research design, it can shed light on otherwise concealed-and critical-political preferences and behaviors among many populations of interest. Through describing one of the first applications of RDS in political science, this article provides empirically grounded guidance via a study of activist refugees from Syria. Refugees are prototypical hard-to-survey populations, and mobilized ones are even more so; yet the study demonstrates that RDS can provide a systematic and representative account of a vulnerable population engaged in major political phenomena.},

We add to the literature on networks and social movements, and movement-countermovement dynamics by 1) comparing network processes amongst a counter movement with those amongst a corresponding social movement, and 2) comparing personal network structures and mobilization processes between countermovement members and the general public. We find a similar pattern of network-based micromobilization processes amongst movement and countermovement participant networks. We find both similarities, and key differences between the counter movement and the general public in terms of activism and social network ties. Theoretical predictions have suggested that individuals who have ties to opposing groups will moderate their participation in a social movement. However, in this study of a community countermovement organization in a small town in Canada that mobilized against the provincial environmental movement we find that the number of contending movement ties (the range of ties to environmental organizations) held by individuals in the countermovement has a significant positive association with countermovement activism, and is the strongest statistical predictor of countermovement activism. Drawing upon both theory and substantive information we discuss the implications of this novel finding.},

Interviews were conducted with 19 residents of the United Kingdom who voted to remain in the referendum, located in constituencies which represented diverse opinion climates in relation to the referendum. Thematic analysis of the data revealed that public opinion was a dilemmatic social representation; it was inscrutable and often ill-informed but also volatile and disruptive, which left open the possibility of it moving towards a more pro-EU position. Importantly, constructions of a polarized and dysfunctional political system worked to sustain a mode of political engagement which prioritized and positioned as efficacious individual rather than collective anti-Brexit political behavior. This implies that people may prefer different types of political participation depending on the opinion climate which they occupy and the way in which they construe it. Findings are discussed in relation to previous work linking meta-representations to political behavior and expression, and the implications of the findings for emergent forms such as Brexit are elaborated.},

These studies often focus on the role of self-interest, group-interest, and race consciousness, but this work has operationalized these concepts in different ways when studying White or Black respondents. Using data from a study in which Whites and Blacks living in Chicago were asked their attitudes toward affirmative action, we build on this body of research by using common measures of self-reported self-interest, group-interest, and race consciousness to predict support for affirmative action. We also examine whether the effects of these determinants are moderated by political ideology. We find that self-reported self-interest influences support for affirmative action among Black conservatives, but not among other respondents. Self-reported group-interest, however, has significant effects that differ between Blacks and Whites and across liberals, moderates, and conservatives.

What enabled responses to COVID-19 to be as effective as they were, right at a time when climate action is notably lagging behind what intergovernmental panels have called for? This paper examines key differences in the COVID-19 response compared to that of climate change, examining the 'deeper' human dimensions of these global issues. Unearthing insights into the responses to both issues provides important lessons for climate change engagement. Technical summary In the first half of 2020, a dramatic, fast and widespread series of changes occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in behaviors, mindsets, culture, and systems. Yet, despite the intergovernmental calls for precisely this kind of fundamental, transformative change across society regarding global warming, public opinion on climate change is fractured and collective action is slow. More research is needed on the psychosocial dimensions of climate change, to better understand what the bottlenecks are for realizing transformative change. In this paper, I examine what occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic response that could be learned for the climate crisis. I focus on three psychological aspects that made the COVID-19 response accessible and actionable in a way that climate change is not: the mental demands for understanding complex issues; psychological distance and its impacts on motivation and agency; and finite attentional resources that can render certain issues as non-salient. Lessons for climate engagement include: (1) the usefulness of concrete, simple, and personally-relatable messaging; (2) more diverse and democratized climate understandings and stories; (3) greater recognition about how psychological distance affects meaning-making and sense of agency; and (4) appreciation of attentional crowding and the need for sense-making strategies about complex issues.

The alternative question format we are urging would put respondents in the position of political subjects, granting them the use of political "ego functions" that are typically arrogated by the major parties.

This article builds on the insights of feminist theory and employs the conceptual vocabulary of the social movement framing perspective in maintaining gender as a main parameter of framing processes. Drawing on ethnographic research on local community struggles against hydropower plants in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey, this article maintains the centrality of gender to framing processes. It analyzes the gendered difference between men's macro-framings and women's cultural and socio-ecological framings, which is rooted in their differing relationships with their immediate environment, as well as with the state and its institutions. The article maintains that the framings of women, which represent the immediacy of the environment, are more effective in gaining public support and shaping movement outcomes. In this sense, constructing gender as an important determinant of "frame variation" is essential not only to reveal women's frames that are largely silenced through and within the mechanisms of social movement organization, but also to stress their centrality in shaping repertoires of contention, public reception and movement outcomes.},

This explorative study examines how INM was reported by nine Canadian print media during its initial upsurge from December 2012 to January 2013. A mixed-methods content analysis reveals that although there were numerous supportive voices discussing INM's contributions to Indigenous self-determination and environmental protection, they were overwhelmed by anti-INM rhetoric advanced by Postmedia Network and its affiliated titles.

This article examines two experimental programs that took the form of forced migration/immigration between the mid-1800s and mid-1900s - the "Orphan Trains" in the United States and the British "Child Migrant Programme". The dire consequences of these programs gained public attention and had a profound impact on the development of the global emerging child welfare movement and concerns for the rights of children.},

The theoretical discussion is complemented with the results of the representative public opinion survey of Lithuanian inhabitants performed in February-March 2016. The empirical results reveal different perceptions of the mayor image which is more based on the 'managerial' leadership style rather than considering him as a politician. The relationships with the local community are perceived as less significant which also reveals the weak identification within local issues and fragmented social interactions with a variety of interest groups.

The foundation of exception from general principle can be found in exercising non-governmental associations' public functions and the nature of the protected benefit. Both cases provide exercising of the principle of cooperation between state and society in the public interest. The realisation of non-governmental associations' authority to defend interests of others is sometimes hindered not only because of their degree of development and absence of any criteria providing effective realisation of defensive function but also because of lack of regulation between non-governmental associations and its relations with executive power bodies (ex. the right to participative decision-making which includes the right to inspect and review documents, providing the grounds for the decision; the right to provide preliminary decisions or opinion expression).

We show how the SMOs developed and expanded the movement using a framing perspective and how the general public became involved through social media. Data was collected via online searching. Interview scripts from key players of SMOs and unofficial documents they provided were also reviewed. Three SMOs primarily led the movement, successfully forming a frame that emphasized social responsibility. SMOs also utilized social media to link their standing frame with unmobilized citizens and to expand the movement. We identified contributing factors and limitations of the movement and drew lessons that could be applied to other sectors where workers are in vulnerable positions.},

Extensive agent-based simulations demonstrate that the optimal strategy fundamentally depends on the goal and time of intervention. Moreover, the nature of the social network (determined by homophily type and level) moderates the effectiveness of a strategy.

	volume = {26},
	issn = {0049-1225},
	abstract = {Observing the processes of political and economic transformation after 1989 it turns out that youth and representatives of the youth's movements are annually more and more pushed out from the social happenings, their subject position marginalizes. Youth is seen by the eyes of public as a problematic and dangerous social group subjected to all traps of the open society. The representatives lose the partnership towards the state step by step, even in the case of keeping and increasing the property of the former youth organization instead of bringing benefits for children and youth of the Slovak Republic. In our opinion, the marginalization problem lays in our totalitarian, brown and red traditions. The system of work with young people, according to one party's aims, reached the high level of ideological unification and political action of youth. This became a tradition influencing the experience and minds of many generations. As a part of this, the young generation was pictured in the public opinion and youth's self-reflection as a historically important subject with a social mission. From this point of view, the contemporaneous problem is not the youth's ”marginalization”, but rather our traditionalism. The modernization is the process of social changes. Sometimes it affects very painfully our traditional waiting for a collectivistic revolutionary behavior of the young generation's movement. The problem of stated social appeal is expected to be sorted out as in the past (e.g. collectivization, urbanization and industrialization, etc.). A substance of the systematic change causes the modern waiting. It tends to combine a modern prosperity of the society with perfect and enormous individual's efforts at the competitive labor market. Youth changes from the homogenous social group (as it was stated in the socialistic social structure) to social-age aggregate of individuals in the certain period of a life circle. A significant change of the original youth's identity is connected with the highest authorities inability to understand this change in the Postsocialistic countries. As well as to accept the fact that the state secure at least appropriate and timely legislative, support financially an elementary infrastructure of the work with youth based on civil youth associations, and secure the stability of the process of socialization. (Merkel, A., 1994). The challenge of the modernization growing from the transformation processes is not delimited only to the young generation. Also other age groups feel to be spoken to. Consequently, this also marginalizes the young generation. This challenge is the challenge for an individual and determined as an individualization. Ken Roberts (1994) states it as a personal disposition or young adolescents ability to take on a responsibility for their decisions as well as admit the risks and social impacts thereof. According to Ivan Velev (1994) individualization is the presumption for the modernization, German sociologists extrapolate it also at the reconstruction of the former totalitarian society in the GDR. For these reasons we consider the transformation of organized youth's movements, changes in position of the civil youth associations, representatives conduct towards the state and youth itself to be a very remarkable sociological phenomenon with its theoretical and pragmatic implications for the processes of modernization. As for active social actors, in accordance to Alain Touraine, it is incontestable that the individuals - actors who seek to achieve personal goals in an environment made up of other agents”...and constituting a community to which they feel they belong and whose culture and rules of institutional functioning they share, at least in part”. (Touraine, A. 1993, p. 425). To produce the active social actors, the existence of certain personal aims is not sufficient. Also an ability to communicate and manifest an engaged citizenship is needed. The representatives of the youth associations were able to unify themselves and manifest their engagement to secure financial and organizational programs of leisure time activities for children and youth from the budget. They cooperated also in the effort to obtain certain possibility to participate at administrative bodies as use more effectively the youth property. The gradual process of the political system transformation is reflected visibly above all in the pluralization of the youth's movement. There is disability and strong disinterest from the representatives to articulate specific interests and needs of the young people in the field of education, professional preparation, social and housing policies. The participation at the social modernization impacts is expected only from the left youth's organizations or special humanity and charity organizations. Interests and needs of youth are more and more distant from the representatives who lose the ability to reflect new processes into meaningful program so that public and youth will accept them as real problems. Generally we can state that during the past period no demands presented by the Slovak Council of Youth (SCY) in the public as youth's interests and needs were supported by civil participation of youth (i.e., petition, recessive demonstration). Furthermore, we do not know the case of SCY applying for the support of those whose interests it represents. This is the specific situation distinguished by A. Touraine in Chile. The admitted representatives of youth into the state administrative bodies and developed communication between state and associations representatives can not supple the sense of the citizenship. According to an author, it is very remarkable that”...while there is such a massive demand everywhere for political participation and dialogue, there is still little capacity for collective action and the ideological formulation of such demands”. (Touraine, A., 1993, p. 426). Moreover, the main aim of the social actors is according to A. Touraine to encourage ”the spirit of the citizenship” in the frame of the youth policy. According to Dieter Rucht (Rucht, D., 1994) it is not enough to create problems of a certain arrangement by the deprivation of individuals and/or by artificial conviction of something wrong with them. The change can be reached by the different institutional arrangement of interests' satisfaction or innovation of the laws. This assumes scandalize opponents occasionally, create intellectual conceptions and strategic programs inspiring the expectations of success, help to make specific conditions also for the mobilization and time stability of the civil movement. The Council of Youth is a collective actor. If support absents, young citizens are not protected from the increasing marginalization or social isolation resulted from subordinated education and youth policies to the market economy or ideology. This explains why do the subjects of the European Council give an attention to the problem of associative youth life. Beside this, the research-analytical effort and methodologies to understand the development of the youth's movement in the Middle European countries seem to be sometimes a type of sociological intervention. They focus to cause expected modernization changes. Experts of the European Council (Stafseng, O., 1994) evaluated positively the certain period of the transformation process according to associative life of youth with the dominant status of plurality in the political system. The challenge for the modernization of Slovakia and to join the structure of Europe is also the challenge for the Slovak Council of Youth to be a collective actor, admit its mission, encourage the ”citizenship” feeling of the young people, and create conditions for articulation and solution of their problems and needs.},

	abstract = {The central bank is a major institution of market economies. As the outcome of a long evolutionary process, the central bank is a creation of the market, not a creation of the state. The modern transaction theory of money and payments systems, coupled with historical evidence drawer from American British experiences, can help show this basic result. Because interbank payments have to be centralized the best way to solve the trade-off between efficiency and security of payments is the settlement of clearing balances on the books of the central bank. This insight leads us to refuse the manicheism of hayekian doctrine with regard to the debate between Free Banking and Central Banking. Because it is the center of the Payments system, the central bank has differentiated itself from other banks through a learning process. Concern for systemic and global stability emerged in the Bank of England during the half century prior to World War I. The Bank developed both the lender of last resort principles and the guidance of the money market by bank rate in order to achieve Convertibility. In the 20th century, powerful social and political trends have nationalized money. The prominence of convertibility has given way to economic policy. However the monetary authorities must have legitimacy to carry out their responsabilities towards the general public. For this involvement to be credible, the central bank shall not support any special interest group. Independence of central banks in the institutional implication of these requirements.},

Using signaling theory (Spence, 1973), the current study examines the outcomes associated with organizations' public declarations of support for the Black community following race-related mega-threats (Leigh \& Melwani, 2019). In Study 1, prospective employees evaluated a specific organization (Ben \& Jerry's) that publicly supported the Black community following race-related mega-threats. Those who perceived higher levels of organizational support for diversity and inclusion (POSDI) reported higher organizational attraction (OA). Study 2 described a fictitious organization that responded to race-related mega-threats by messaging support for either Black Lives Matter (BLM), Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, or no social movement. Prospective employees perceived higher levels of POSDI when the company issued a statement in support of BLM (relative to the other movements), which in turn was associated with higher OA. Study 3 focused on current employees and examined how POSDI influences financial outcomes in real Fortune 500 companies. Organizations that issued statements publicly supporting the Black community following a race-related mega-threat received higher POSDI ratings by employees, which predicted increased organizational revenue, even after controlling for revenue prior to making the statements. In sum, organizations that signal public support for the Black community in the wake of a race-related mega-threat not only increase prospective employees' POSDI, but may also boost OA and, ultimately, financial revenue.},

Through a case study of the Umbrella Movement Visual Archive (UMVA) in Hong Kong, this paper explores the risks faced by and the strategies of the archivists when preserving social movement objects amidst rapid autocratisation. Based on semi-structured interviews and documents analysis, this paper argues that autocratisation significantly restrains political opportunities for archival activism. When Hong Kong was relatively liberal before 2020, the UMVA encountered problems common in community archives in liberal democracies, such as sustainability crises and loss of public attention. Even so, archivists could still manage the risk by facilitating public communication and group solidarity. Nonetheless, the rapid autocratisation of Hong Kong since 2020 has created extreme political risks for archivists and the collection. Archivists could only migrate the archives overseas, resulting in public inaccessibility of the collection. While most extant literature on archival activism focuses on democratic or post-transitional context, this project offers an authoritarian-political perspective that tests the limits of the notion in the global wave of democratic backsliding.},

Through consolidation, an originally adjoint city is merged with a county, facilitating the sustainable development of collective action within local governments. This study empirically corroborated the relationship between the time since local government consolidation (in years) and sustainability. Open government data were used to establish a secondary database; data from Taiwan's 22 cities and counties were collected over a multiyear period, before and after county-city consolidation. Time-series analysis and event history analysis (survival analysis models) were employed to corroborate whether county-city consolidation positively affects sustainability. County-city consolidation contributed to improvements in sustainability, only in regard to the growth rate of per capita annual disposable income and the growth rate of tertiary education of 15+ age in the jurisdictions. This research then concluded that the extreme integration approach of local governments under county-city consolidation may promote collective sustainability-related benefits, but it may simultaneously enlarge the poverty gap in the society.},

Our cross-national analysis shows that both media- and country-level characteristics explain news coverage of domestic social protests. Our findings show that web news outlets with high web traffic and a propensity to report conflictual events tend to cover more protests. In addition, web news sites in nations with vibrant civil society organizations report more protest events. We also find that there is a positive relationship between online censorship and news coverage in general. But this is driven by news media in democratic countries, and news sites in authoritarian regimes experiencing strong censorship cover fewer protest events. Finally, news media in authoritarian nations with more organizational ties to the international community cover more domestic protests.},

These mechanisms interacted and reinforced one another in the mobilization process of candlelight rallies for six months.

	abstract = {In the United States, striking racial disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality rates were one of the core patterns of the virus. These racial disproportionalities were a result of structural factors-laws, rules, and practices embedded in economic, social, and political systems. Public policy is central among such structural features. Policies distribute advantages, disadvantages, benefits, and burdens in ways that generate, reinforce, or redress racial inequities. Crucially, public policy is a function of power relations, so understanding policy decisions requires attentiveness to power. This paper asseses statistical associations between racial power and state anti-eviction policies. Charting the timing of state policy responses between March 2020 and June 2021, I examine correlations between response times and racial power as reflected in state populations, voting constituencies, legislatures, and social movement activities. Ultimately, I do not find any significant associations. The null results underscore the complexities and difficulties of studying race, power, and public policy with theoretical nuance and empirical care. While the findings leave us with much to learn about how racial power operates, the conceptualization and theorizing offered in the paper, instructively underscore the value of centering racial power in analyses of public policy.},

	abstract = {How does exposure to government repression shape bystander willingness to mobilize into a protest or demonstration? A robust body of scholarship has argued that repression can backfire, motivating activists to take to the streets after the government clamps down. Yet, while the evidence is strong that highly motivated and risk-acceptant citizens are willing to step up, less is known about how repression affects the majority of citizens who do not frequently participate in protests. Yet, theories of civil resistance often depend on mobilizing bystanders. I examine this by drawing on geocoded survey data as well as incident-level data of repression across Africa. I measure each respondent's exposure to government repression across multiple spatial and temporal buffers. Contrary to expectations in the civil resistance literature, I find that exposure to repression correlates with a lower willingness to consider joining a protest or demonstration. The closer a respondent is, both temporally and spatially, to an incident of repression, the less likely they are to report that they would consider joining a protest. The results are robust to additional testing specifications that address issues of endogeneity, social desirability bias, and omitted variable bias.},

The sinarquistas shared many of the features of fascism and Nazism, the major global antidemocratic movements of the time, including a strident nationalism, authoritarian leanings, an emphasis on martial discipline and strict organizational structure, and a militant aesthetic. Both its ideological leanings and rapid growth (as many as 500,000 members by the early 1940s) led many US writers to suggest that the UNS represented a dangerous fifth-column threat to both Mexico and the United States. Others, particularly in the Catholic press, saw the UNS as an anticommunist organization that could actually help foster democracy in Mexico. For their part, UNS leaders defended themselves vociferously and sought to build relationships with influential US Catholics who could advocate for them in the press. By analyzing this debate, this paper both underscores the transnational characteristics of the UNS and highlights the crucial role of US public opinion in Mexican politics during the 1940s.},

They were an expression of discontent with the economic model and social policies implemented in both countries in recent decades. The purpose of this study is to investigate how Chilean and Colombian news websites framed these social protests and what aspects of the social movements promoted these media to public opinion. Design/methodology/approach The methodology of this research is empirical; the authors use quantitative and discourse analysis techniques to study the news published by the top three most visited main news websites in each country and deduce the main frameworks emerging from them. After analyzing the framing of reality by media in 4,252 news items, the authors suggest that the main news portals in these Latin American countries not only portrayed the collective actions but also promoted interpretations that did not necessarily reflect the demands of the demonstrations. Findings The findings were that in the 2019 protests in Chile and Colombia, the media approach to collective action was not necessarily positive for the activists. This was mainly because framing in the Chilean and Colombian websites had to do with negative aspects of the movements, such as violence or economic costs. Originality/value The originality and value of this research is that despite the fact that there are abundant case studies on the relationship between social movements and media framing in the literature, this study adds to the current knowledge because it compares two Latin American countries and focuses on Web news portals.},

As in other cities, a group of progressive rank-and-file teachers working toward transformative change moved their union toward social movement unionism, and in the process, garnered the support of communities of color that had been alienated from organized teachers. Drawing on in-depth interviews with teacher activists involved in the 2019 Oakland teacher strike, I demonstrate how strategic decisions to focus on gaining power within the union and to center the leadership of progressive teachers of color, especially women of color, helped to build public support for both the strike and the broader movement against privatization, yet also led them to focus on an inside strategy that may undermine their more transformative goals. I argue that as activist teachers gain power within their unions, activist groups that function independently from the union provide a critical outside space where teachers can develop an intersectional and transformative praxis that helps them better strategize against the racial politics of advocacy in the neoliberal context.},

Some scholars have argued that such an approach is the best lens to view the governance of climate change and that a polycentric approach has advantages in addressing collective-action problems. However, taking a polycentric approach would require public support for action at multiple scales. The issue of climate change is polarized across political beliefs and cultural worldviews and little research has examined how the public views climate action at one level of government relative to others as well as relative to actions by the private sector and by individuals. Using an original survey of the US public from October 2017, I explore who it is that the public thinks should "do more" about climate change and the role that the cultural worldviews posited by cultural theory-hierarchical, egalitarian, individualist, and fatalist-plays in shaping those opinions. Overall, I find support for multiple actors doing more to address climate change, but with differences in support between egalitarians and individualists for actors overall and for the federal government in particular.},

As we move into the 21(st) century, one of the institutional transformations is catalyzed by the emergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a techno-economic paradigm shift and the epochal creation of a new online social structure. However, there is a lack of understanding about the impact of ICT on common resource management, particularly in urban settings, that is urban commons. This study presents a systematic literature review of ICT-enabled urban commons with particular attention to its application to climate-related issues such as climate mitigation/adaptation in order to improve our collective ability to leverage ICT for building a more sustainable and resilient city. A total of 66 pieces of literature were included in our qualitative synthesis. We analyzed the geographical, categorical, and climate relevance. Subsequently, we used the coupled infrastructure system framework as a system thinking approach to dissect distinct usefulness of ICT-enabled commons in the building of relationships between resource system, resource user, infrastructure, and infrastructure provider to tackle climate-related issues. Our findings identified three key contributions of ICT to innovate climate-resilient solutions: 1) to redefine role of resource user as co-producer, co-designer, and co-monitor; 2) to enable real-time data-driven urban planning; 3) to improve resource efficiency and effectiveness. In other words, in a time of insufficient and limited public resources, the public sector can leverage the power of technology to harness public support and engage non-traditional stakeholders to make cities more sustainable and resilient while allowing policy-making to be big data-driven to tackle new urban problems that cannot be otherwise uncovered without the aid of ICT. The results provide directions to rethink the city based on collective action to diversity modes to govern common resources.},

A fairly representative Swedish sample (N = 2911) rated the acceptability of 44 environmental policies. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that participants' acceptability of policies forms three categories: push policies consisting of regulatory and market-based disincentives, pull policies consisting mainly of market-based incentives, and informational policies, such as ecolabeling. Sociodemographics had small but consistent effects on attitudes towards the three categories, while political ideology had a larger effect across the categories.

	abstract = {In 2020, men in Turkey murdered 300 women, and 171 women were found suspiciously dead. The dominant narrative around suspicious death cases involves a faulty assumption that women are prone to committing suicide. Women's organisations and cause lawyers unite against all kinds of violence to challenge this dominant narrative, which grants impunity to perpetrators. Drawing on resource mobilisation theory, this article investigates how women's organisations become involved in femicide and suspicious death cases to articulate counter-narratives and advance women's access to justice. It focuses on Sule cet's case, which raised intense public reactions due to the lack of procedural fairness at the investigation stage. It relies on semi-structured interviews with Sule's lawyer and the members of the We Will Stop Femicide Platform (Kadin Cinayetlerini Durduracagiz Platformu) and the Gelincik Centre (Gelincik Merkezi) to illustrate how women's organisations made Sule's story visible and countered the dominant narrative surrounding suspicious death cases. The findings illustrate that women's organisations' ongoing struggle to encourage courts to hear women's stories demands co-operation between different social and legal mechanisms. It includes a combination of several strategies, such as following femicide cases and forming public opinion through social media. The article concludes by arguing that women's organisations' use of counter-narratives transforms femicide cases from being only a statistic to a public cause, contributing to women's struggle in accessing justice.},

As hypothesized, socio-political efficacy increased after the successful nationwide lockdowns. In turn, socio-political efficacy amplified respondents' pro-environmental attitudes including climate beliefs and concern, as well as support for a government subsidy for public transport and opposition to government spending on new motorways. The pandemic also enhanced respondents' satisfaction with the quality of the natural environment, which was unmediated by socio-political efficacy.

What we do not know is whether these types of citations might carry any potential implications for public perceptions of the Court's decisions as this phenomenon becomes more prevalent and people become equipped with this information. To test this empirically, I implement a survey experiment with approximately 3000 respondents that assesses acceptance of Supreme Court opinions that cite interest-group-filed amicus curiae briefs. I find that the public is less accepting of decisions that cite ideologically overt interests in the aggregate and less accepting of decisions that cite interest groups that are ideologically incompatible with their own preferences. However, the public does not view Supreme Court decision making as political, even when the justices cite ideologically charged groups. Taken together, these findings suggest the public uses interest group source cues to evaluate Supreme Court decisions when equipped with this information and that while the public responds negatively to politics in Supreme Court decisions, the Court maintains its image as a nonpolitical entity.},

In this review, we use the latest empirical evidence in psychology and related sociobehavioral sciences to document sentiment regarding Black Lives Matter. Because continuing racial inequity is a foundational assumption of Black Lives Matter, we will also review the most relevant studies of attention to, knowledge of, and beliefs and feelings about police violence and related acts and issues that may be viewed as indicating racial inequity. Much of this work shows a dramatic divergence of sentiment across racial and political lines, as increased social and political polarization and insulation evidences in divergent attention, cognition, affect, emotion, motivation, and action regarding relevant events and social issues. In this way, examinations of the psychology of such sentiment reveal just how deep the social and political rifts run in society.},

With data from two samples (one identified with militant protesters and the other with moderate protesters) in the anti-ELAB movement, we validated two classical pathways in the GAE among Hong Kong residents. Among people identifying with militant protesters, perceiving excessive police action and collective efficacy with militant protesters were significantly associated with support for militant protest via contempt rather than anger. Among people identifying with moderate protesters, perceiving excessive police action and collective efficacy with moderate protesters were significantly associated with support for moderate protest via anger rather than contempt. In addition, we extended the GAE by validating a new pathway that those identifying with moderate protesters would also support militant protest when they felt contempt. The findings indicate that the association between emotion and attitude toward collective action is not fully based on group identification. Our findings unpacked public support for militant protest into support from people identifying with militant protesters and support from those identifying with moderate protesters. The results of this research indicate that the solidarity between militant and moderate protesters in the anti-ELAB movement was not only a tactical cooperation but also a common emotional response (contempt). Our findings propose political communication as a potentially effective manner to deradicalize public attitudes, the core of which should be to mitigate people's contempt.},

To understand the current gaps in CH research and the extent of the involvement of public gardens in CH, surveys were conducted among the two groups, CH/extension researchers and staff of public gardens. The results of the surveys were presented at the virtual conference of the American Society for Horticultural Science on 12 Aug. 2020 during a workshop hosted by the Consumer Horticulture and Master Gardener Professional Interest Group. The workshop included four presentations, and two of those are discussed in this paper: 1) research gaps in CH and 2) bridging the divide between CH and public gardens. Among researchers, even though there was a general understanding of CH, there was a disconnect in participants' perceptions of the roles of CH in the economy and recreation. The greatest knowledge gap was in basic horticultural practices. Regarding public garden professionals, there needs to be a concerted effort to educate them about CH so they can provide a consistent message to their audiences and the general public.},

	abstract = {One might assume that in a working democracy the criminal law rules would reflect the community's shared judgments regarding justice and punishment. This is especially true because social science research shows that lay people generally think about criminal liability and punishment in consistent ways: in terms of desert, doing justice, and avoiding injustice. Moreover, there are compelling reasons to demand consistency between community views and criminal law rules, including respect for democratic values, effective crime-control, and the deontological value of justice itself. It may then come as a surprise, and a disappointment, that a wide range of common rules in modern criminal law conflict with community justice judgments, including three strikes and other habitual offender statutes, abolition or narrowing of the insanity defense, adult prosecution of juveniles, felony murder, strict liability offenses, and a variety of other common doctrines. In short, democratically elected legislatures have regularly chosen to adopt criminal law rules that conflict with the deep and abiding intuitions of their constituents. We endeavor to explain how this incongruent situation has arisen. Using the legislative and political histories of the doctrines noted above, we document four common causes: legislative mistake about the community's justice judgments, interest group pressure, prioritizing coercive crime-control mechanisms over doing justice and legislative preference for delegating some criminalization decisions to other system actors, such as prosecutors and judges. Analysis of these reasons and their dynamics suggests specific reforms, including a legislative commitment to reliably determine community judgment before enactment and to publicly explain the reasons for enacting any criminal law rule that conflicts. Creation of a standing criminal law reform commission would be useful to oversee the social science research and to help hold the legislature to these public promises.},

We demonstrate that Canadians having more (less) contact with immigrants are less (more) supportive of such penalties. We also uncover a double standard by which some Canadians were more supportive of cannabis-related penalties specific to immigrants but not more supportive of cannabis-related penalties for Canadians more generally. Contact between different groups (i.e., intergroup contact) is well supported as a means to reduce negative intergroup attitudes. It is important, however, to explore outcomes of intergroup contact beyond intergroup attitudes, especially outcomes tied to social change such as policy support. We examined the relationship between intergroup contact and support (or lack of support) for cannabis-related policies and penalties specific to immigrants. We examined this in Canada, where the recent legalization of cannabis led to new policies with varying degrees of public support. Among Canadian undergraduates, we found that more contact with immigrants was associated with lower support for relatively harsh cannabis-related penalties for immigrants. In particular, having higher-quality contact with immigrants was associated with greater opposition to such penalties. Additionally, those higher in right-wing ideology were more supportive of penalties for outgroup members (immigrants) than ingroup members (Canadians in general). Future directions and potential implications of the findings are discussed.},

The findings indicate that public perceptions by country are not radically different from commonly known government-level orientations toward China. Yet there are interesting patterns of clusters across countries and gaps in perceptions. First, some countries consistently regard China more influential and more beneficial than the U.S. while others face a contradiction between China being more influential but less beneficial than the U.S. Second, in all countries, Southeast Asian respondents think that the extent to which China benefits their own country is greater than the extent to which China benefits the region, implying a potential collective action problem for a coherent regional response. It is also interesting to note that the largest perception gap is reported in the Philippines, the country at the forefront of the South China Sea disputes with China.

Exploration of the role of counterhegemonic challenges in this process through ethnographic fieldwork, interviews with activists and scholars, newspaper archives, and social movement materials shows that the organization purposefully increased the visibility of stigmatized segments of Jujuy society, defying official narratives about the province. This strategy allowed the organization to recruit members and raise its national profile but also engendered the unified opposition of local elites, which used their control of strategic assets to turn public opinion against activists, portraying them as violent, corrupt, and above all foreign.

Una exploracion de trabajo de campo etnografico en torno al papel que jugaron los desafios contrahegemonicos en este proceso, asi como entrevistas con activistas y academicos, y consulta de materiales hemerotecnicos y de movimientos sociales muestra que la organizacion aumento deliberadamente la visibilidad de segmentos estigmatizados de la sociedad jujena, desafiando las narrativas oficiales sobre la provincia. Esta estrategia permitio a la organizacion reclutar miembros y elevar su perfil nacional, pero tambien engendro la oposicion unificada de las elites locales, que utilizaron su control de activos estrategicos para volver a la opinion publica en contra de los activistas, presentandolos como violentos, corruptos y, sobre todo, foraneos.},

In this article, we articulate an analytical framework for studying memory activists, proposing a relatively narrow definition: "Memory activists" strategically commemorate the past to challenge (or protect) dominant views on the past and the institutions that represent them. Their goal is mnemonic change or to resist change. We locate scholarship on memory activists at the intersection of memory studies and social movement studies. We introduce a typology for comparative analysis of memory activism according to activist roles, temporality, and modes of interaction with other actors in memory politics, and illustrate this with a diverse set of empirical examples. We contend that the analytical utility of the concept of the "memory activist" is premised on its value-neutrality, and in particular, its application to both pro and anti-democratic cases of activism.},

When powerful figures use the "emotional expression" of an "emotional community" to "control" the "emotions" of the general public, thus transforming the "emotions" of the people into exuberant extremes, the "emotional community" is unable to influence the direction of the movement. At the same time, powerful figures can use the "emotional community" of "emotional expression" to mobilize the general public at a certain time, forming a social tide. But since the powerful are ultimately unable to translate the "emotions" of the "community" into the emotions of millions of people, any manipulated social movement is unlikely to last.

	abstract = {In Northwest Indiana, a new urban forestry effort called CommuniTree has emerged with a goal of helping solve some of the region's post-industrial social and ecological issues. Though no panacea, tree planting can have significant benefits, including air pollution abatement, temperature moderation, stormwater management, and beautification. CommuniTree is a Collective Impact-style collaborative of over a dozen partner groups (public, nonprofit, private, and partnership organizations) that plants trees on public and industrial properties in postindustrial Northwest Indiana communities where urban forestry governance and resources are relatively lacking. This paper presents the results of the first phase of a transdisciplinary research program that draws insights from urban forest governance scholarship and transdisciplinary sustainability science as well as from urban forest professionals involved in CommuniTree who helped design the research. We used a transdisciplinary case study approach with qualitative interviews with key informants from CommuniTree partner organizations to investigate partner organizations' motivations for participating, desired outcomes, and long-term visions for CommuniTree. We find that the CommuniTree partnership itself is an intrinsic incentive to partners' participation: once an influential champion brought the group together, they were motivated to stay involved by the work and structure of CommuniTree. The scant existing urban forest governance in the region also motivated partners to contribute to CommuniTree collective action. For desired outcomes, we find that partners are interested in the potential improvements to ecological quality that may result for the region such as improved stormwater management and air quality, but that more than ecological outcomes, partners are interested in the social outcomes that might come of the CommuniTree, including engaging communities in ecological stewardship activities and the beautification and general improvements to public spaces that result from tree planting. And for its future, partners conveyed a plurality of visions for CommuniTree's growth including expanding the program to new communities, planting trees on new types of locations, and involving more partners, the general public, and new volunteer groups. However, current CommuniTree structure has vulnerabilities to its sustainability and longevity, including a reliance on predominantly grant funding, shifting organizational dynamics within/among partners, and a lack of systematic integration of the voices of local community members. In conclusion, this research on CommuniTree's structure and function (i.e., the governance and activities) and on what partners value as desired outcomes and for the future informs an understanding of the vulnerabilities and opportunities for CommuniTree as the program evolves to better meet the needs of current partners, future stakeholders, and, most importantly, community members.},

This analysis of Facebook news posts of protests by mainstream U.S. news organizations contributes to our understanding of how social media's engagement affordances work in cohort with journalists' use of emotional appeals to legitimize some protests and delegitimize others. Results show posts encourage the mobilization of some protests more than others, and media frames and emotional linguistic devices might contribute to a spectrum of delegitimizing framing effects. Legitimizing features significantly decrease emotional reactions from audiences, leading to more neutral but potentially less engaging audience reception and response.

The results show that both the perceived damage to reputation and collective efficacy relate positively to participation intent. Through structural equation modeling, we elaborate how news consumption on different media platforms and interpersonal discussions influence civil servants' political participation indirectly through affecting the perception of their reputation and collective efficacy.

Several interesting findings emerge. First, Republicans are more likely to favor military spending, a finding that is both statistically and substantively significant throughout our analysis. In addition, interest group campaign contributions play an important role by increasing the probability a legislator supports defense spending. Third, when a congressional district has a larger number of veterans or a lower rate of unemployment, its elected legislator is likely to favor military spending.

	abstract = {Motivation The public needs to be better informed on the reasons for providing aid, especially that which supports the Sustainable Development Goals. How aid is framed by donors directly affects levels of public support. Purpose The article investigates support for aid among English-speaking Canadians, and how this varies by the framing of aid spending, socioeconomic markers, personal values and political engagement. Approach and methods Statistical analysis is undertaken of data from a representative survey of English-speaking Canadians on their knowledge and attitudes with respect to aid to developing countries. A particular focus of the analysis is the influence of the framing of aid spending on public support for aid spending, while controlling for the influence of socioeconomic factors. Findings Support for increased spending rises when spending is framed relative to the size of the economy, whether in dollar or percentage terms, rather than when framed relative to government taxation or spending. Providing information on the current level of aid spending also raises support for increased aid spending. Overall, when informed about the level of aid spending, most respondents support maintaining or increasing aid. Views on aid vary little by age, education and other socioeconomic markers. People's values, however, did affect support for aid. Respondents who believe in "Canada first" were considerably more likely to support aid cuts than others. Those who see kindness as part of Canadian identity tend to favour aid, while those who see economic prosperity as part of national identity tend to want aid cuts. While voting intention does not affect views on aid, respondents who have been either politically active or involved in collective action on media/social media are a little more likely to favour increased aid. Policy implications The findings confirm the importance of the framing of aid spending for designing and implementing programmes to inform, engage and elicit support from the public. Given how values influence public support for aid, engagement needs to be tailored to different target audiences.},

It looks at how leaders engage in exchanges of valued rewards with constituencies, institutional political players, bystander publics, and voluntary organizations. Leaders receive from these players important rewards (like committed activists, political leverage, and resources) for achieving movement goals. In turn, leaders make strategic choices (expressed in frames, tactics, targets, and claims) that other players find rewarding, favoring persistent exchanges across time. By considering movements' simultaneous exchanges with several players, the theory makes sense of choices that remain puzzling for major movement theories. It also blends strategic behavior with culture (in the form of utopias, ideology, and emotions) but does not require the maximizing assumption of the homo economicus. I use the case of the contemporary Chilean student movement to illustrate the theory.},

In Study 1, we showed that intention to participate in a protest movement in reaction to an unfavourable distribution of outcomes was lower when legitimacy of the group's authority was high (vs. low). In addition, a reduction in anger was found to play a mediating role. Studies 2 and 3 further demonstrated that these effects only occurred when participants were confronted with a relatively low disadvantage (as opposed to a high disadvantage). In an attempt to identify underlying mechanisms, Study 3 emphasized the moral implications that lie behind responses to high (vs. low) disadvantageous decisions and that shape resistance processes.

The movement in Kyiv grew into a nation-wide contention in which local Maidan actors issued their own demands to authorities. The larger consequence was the resignation of the President and new elections, followed by a military conflict in the east of the country. To examine the outcomes of Maidans from the participants' point of view, I used primary documents issued by protest assemblies in 2013-2014 to select four local communities as case studies and, in 2018, held 24 interviews with 33 Maidan activists, representatives of local authorities, and observers. My findings suggest that local Maidans resulted in a rotation of local elites, but also in shifts of the receptiveness of local authorities to public opinion. These changes, however, mostly did not spread, which is due to the military conflict that ensued immediately after Maidan.},

These policies present intrusiveness and relevance for Brussels-based and national civil rights NGOs since they both aim to touch upon individual liberties, like privacy rights or the right to protect personal data. The article goes further by opening up the black box of politicisation. It does so by assuming that politicisation is characterised by a certain level of salience, actor range and polarisation.

But what are the effects of conveying that people are angry? And how do they contrast with more traditional norm messages about climate policy support? Here, we investigate whether social norm messaging about collective anger can impact perceptions of consensus and public support for climate mitigation. In a pilot study and two survey experiments (total N = 1529), we find that relative to control messages, normative appeals that convey growing public anger about U.S. inaction on climate change (i.e., dynamic anger consensus messaging) can enhance Americans' consensus estimates of other Americans' climate-related beliefs and support for mitigation policy, and expectations for future climatemitigating collective action. Moreover, exposure to a dynamic anger consensus message led to similar estimates of Americans' policy support and belief in climate change as messages that explicitly conveyed public support for climate mitigation (Study 1) or consensus belief in anthropogenic climate change (Study 2). When tailored for a cross-partisan audience, anger consensus messaging was also effective in bolstering personal support for climate mitigation (Study 2). Notably, similar effects were observed across partisan groups. These findings suggest that, by signaling shared motivational states, emotion consensus appeals can enhance expectations for social change, with the potential to mobilize bipartisan support for climate mitigation.},

Using survey data collected in four US cities before and after the 'long hot summer' of urban unrest in 1967, we examine changes in public opinion about whether rioters reacted to legitimate grievances and whether the unrest would be effective in helping the plight of Black Americans. We find that violence expanded the opinion gap between the dominant white 'public' and Black 'counterpublic.' We also find unique opinion patterns among within-race subgroups based on gender and education (Black women and college-educated whites). In effect, violence realigned the structure of public opinion allies for the Civil Rights Movement.},

The responses are compared with opinion data to estimate the level of political (in)equality. The findings from the case of Sweden - where relatively high levels of equality would be expected, but striking levels of inequality based on socio-economic status are instead found - highlight the perseverance of what Schattschneider once called the upper-class bias of the pressure system.},

We approach this puzzle from two angles: how sensitive are citizens to cost implications of agricultural subsidies, and what is their "value function" with respect to agricultural policy? We argue that farm subsidies, besides benefiting farmers, promise to generate an array of non-market goods that serve various interests in society and thus receive strong support overall. To test our argument, we conducted conjoint survey experiments in two countries: Switzerland and the United States. Our results show that while cost implications only marginally reduce support for subsidies, support is positively affected by the allocation of subsidies to various policy goals, such as guaranteeing food security and enhancing animal welfare. These findings suggest that individual-level support for agricultural subsidies does not result from a lack of information, but reflect genuine appreciation of the perceived multi-functionality of agricultural subsidies.},

We propose five competing models based on previous theories of emotion, race, and political views in social movement support. To adjudicate between these frameworks, we conduct an experiment using a 2x2 factorial design in which participants read a news story about a protest accompanied by an image of a neutral/angry, white/Black protestor, measuring three types of social movement support, and examine results and model fit. Results provide support for a politicized-race model: a Black protestor is more motivating for liberals' social movement support, while a white protestor is more motivating for conservatives. Both liberals and conservatives are more likely to associate the protest with violence after seeing a Black protestor compared to a white one. Racialized perceptions of violence explain part of conservatives' hesitancy to support the movement when seeing a Black protestor and inhibits part of the otherwise-positive effect of seeing a Black protestor for liberals.},

This article examines the 2007-2008 Hollywood Writers' Strike as a case of a fragmented labour force in a creative industry. The article explores how social networks serve as facilitators of solidarity among workers and participation in strike events. There is robust empirical evidence in the literature, showing that organizational structure in the workplace determines social ties among workers, and these pre-existing ties are likely to have an effect on workers' commitment to and participation in a strike. However, this empirical literature is limited in the sense that it does not consider the evolution of social networks during organizing and strikes. Therefore, this study seeks to understand the effect of collective action on interpersonal relations among the participants, and the role of these ties on future strike participation. The main contribution of this article is to empirically show that social networks during a strike are dynamic, and participation in a strike is very much a function of these networks. We also show that propinquity and network intentionality were important tie formation mechanisms in the picket lines. The implications of these findings for organizers and trade-offs between hierarchical and decentralized mobilizations are also discussed.},

The results of the study confirm the relevance of the theory especially in times of crisis or in the case of unannounced and sudden outbreaks of resentment, when the usual explanatory models of political action are not sufficient. The results show that the main trigger of collective action is not absolute distress, but that protest behaviour can be the result of a relative degree of deprivation in a social group.

In Turkey, it is undeniable that the European Union associated Turkish objectives have been the primary engine of institutional transformation in the country for a long time. Some historical turning moments in Europe-Turkey ties, as well as the associated actions of governments and public opinion towards the Turkish constitution, imply that there is almost a visible correlation between constitutional change and EU-Turkey relations, at least in the short term.

Since cultural, religious, political and social norms / motivations differ, the method of combating inequality and struggle shows differences. Although their struggles, methods, demands and conditions in which they were born are different, it is possible to say that the common point shared by these movements is "fighting capitalism and opposition to imperialism". None social movement in Latin America has succeed to create a public opinion and as much attention as The Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST) in Brazil in terms of their method and public reaction. The movement, which is known well-organized, powerful and most active organization in Brazil and Latin America; is one of the most successful organizations in the fight against inequality in terms of method, content and dissemination. This arises from strong ideological formation and the organizational structure of the movement. This article focuses on the MST (also known as the Landless Movement), which adopts a method that has never been tried in the fight against inequality and has achieved very successful results. This paper aimed to examine which philosophical and ideological roots the actions (occupations) are based on and how it legitimizes these actions, apart from the work systematics that the organization has tempered in combating inequality and the examination of the factors that ensure its success. The article is based on three basic arguments. First of all, apart from many different aspects of the MST, the most important features that differs the movement from other social movements is that it has undertaken the mission of creating a "new person" except for aiming to transform economic and social relations. Secondly, the most important reason for MST's success comes from its decentralized structure and the ability of the occupants to take initiative. Finally, the movement's strongest motivation to achieve results in the fight against inequality is that it has created a "de facto situation" and that it has the power of "mobilizing large masses of people".},

Designed to create a safe space for communicating political differences, the methodology also aims to break down the distinction between researchers and researched and engages the latter as co-researchers. In our first application of CFGA, solidarity was exhibited across political and cultural divides, demonstrating the methodology's potential to support collaborative knowledge-making among co-researchers with different political stances and educational and cultural backgrounds. By analysing the patterns of interaction that emerged within CFGA, we identify strategies for building 'situated solidarity' and maintaining 'non-hierarchical dialogues'.

Our study is based on 97 individual interviews with representatives of transnational solidarity organisations (TSOs) located in Germany, Poland, and Greece. We show how their understanding of solidarity varies across three basic themes: the rationale of action, the scope of beneficiaries, and relations with and among beneficiaries. Most strikingly, our research reveals that the core understanding of solidarity among the TSOs under review reflects a progressive, transnational type of solidarity that emphasises universalism, connection-building between targets of solidarity and establishing group identities based on collective action and not pre-defined features. At the same time, our study shows how TSOs adapt to complex country- and field-specific contextual conditions.},

On the other hand, conflict is a central concept in framing studies and public opinion, but it has never been systematically operationalized in this research area. As a result of these two shortcomings, no study to date has addressed the effects of conflict frames on citizens' emotions. This work intends to do so by means of an experiment which implements a gradual operationalization of conflict frames using a story about the Spanish Indignados movement. The empirical analyses confirm a net effect of the intensity of the conflict on anxiety and, especially, anger. Furthermore, previous sympathy for the social movement featured in the story and individual's ideology enhance the emotional effects of conflict.},

The survey results reveal that while our respondents generally favoredcollaborative governance(i.e., public officials with private stakeholders) overcollaborative government(i.e., public officials only), it was largely due to the inclusion of private citizens, not the stakeholder group representatives. This finding is consistent with a populist framework that presumes that interest group influences tend to impede or distort the will of the electoral majority and that favors functionally delimited mandates and limited power for non-elected decision-making bodies.

After reading an argument supporting a policy, respondents were significantly more likely than the control group to support the (strong or weak) policy endorsed by the argument, although broader policy views were unaffected. Policy endorsements had the same effect on policy preferences whether or not emphasis frames were used, and the effects were not moderated by the personal importance of climate change. Overall, the moderate effect sizes suggest that interest groups have limited influence over the public's climate policy preferences.},

Meanwhile, academic literature features a number of explicitly political interpretations of flash mobs. However, to date, no empirical study has addressed why individuals organize and take part in the internationally spread mass events organized by the most popular contemporary flash mob incarnation, the Urban Playground Movement (UPM). In this paper, we place Budapest's UPM on an entertainment practice versus social movement mobilization spectrum. Our interviews with the leaders of the largest Hungarian UPM organization show that the functioning of the UPM in Budapest heavily relies on social movement continuity, where organizers see their events as ways to reclaim public spaces and to prefigure more social cities. However, among participants surveyed at the most notable yearly UPM event, the International Pillow Fight Day, we found fun as the primary motivation for participation, thus showing movement discontinuity. We conclude that the UPM in Budapest is a collective action, but not a social movement. Secondly, we find that the UPM exhibits 'thin' diffusion both in its reliance on individual activists over coalitions and in its usage of commercial social media as its diffusion infrastructure. Lastly, our results show that UPM collectives can act as 'containers' of social movement frames, implying that these playful groups could function as vehicles in the spread of protest in movement milieus. Our key finding that UPM is not a social movement contradicts the numerous academic interpretations of flash mobs as outright political events.},

We take the case of the framing of economic inequality in the news in order to make an empirical contribution and a conceptual contribution. The framing of economic inequality in news coverage is important to understand as news frames can shape public opinion and subsequently policy responses to inequality. There is no research we are aware of that documents how economic inequality is framed in the news. We compiled a dataset of 2109 news articles, published between 2000 and 2014, about economic inequality, and conducted a detailed content analysis. Empirically, we document how inequality was framed as an issue, specifically whether it was framed as a social problem with negative consequences, and what its causes, consequences, and solutions were. Conceptually, we also address an important gap in knowledge about the determinants of news frames. Research about how news frames are shaped by contextual factors in the production of news is uncertain about which factors matter and to what extent. The dataset has a set of features that allow us to simultaneously examine a number of potential determinants of news frames. Our data allow us to compare the relative influences on news coverage of economic inequality of (1) national context, (2) the political leaning of newspapers, (3) changing economic conditions, and (4) social movement efforts. Of these four factors, we find that only the Occupy movement influenced the volume of attention and the identification of economic inequality as a problem with negative consequences. National context, political leaning, and change in economic conditions had much more limited, or no, influence. Following the emergence of the Occupy movement, attention to economic inequality increased and remained higher than before. However, despite the clear effects of the Occupy movement on problem identification, news coverage of the causes and solutions to economic inequality did not significantly shift. We, therefore, find that social movement activity had the clearest influence on news frames, but the observed effect in this case was superficial rather than detailed.},

I demonstrate that despite an explicit intention and commitment to foster support for refugees, the pro-refugee groups' choice of frames could have been more strategic if they would have not neglected media counter frames. I argue that although the literature's focus on dynamics of movement and media frames has provided useful tools for analysing the relation between the two, engaging with media counter frames is as equally important, especially if we are concerned with questions around strategy and the outcomes of social mobilizations. Empirically, this article provides a unique insight into micro politics of pro-refugee mobilizations in Europe.

	abstract = {Introduction. The article is devoted to the analysis of the protest political mobilization in the regional political space of Volgograd region. Particular attention is paid to the study of the main conditions and causes of protest activity in the context of implementing public policy in Volgograd region. The relevance of the problem field is due to the need for a political analysis of the characteristics of the population mobilization at the regional level, including their comparison with federal trends. Methodology and methods. The authors conceptualize political mobilization on the basis of the theoretical principles of the theory of collective behavior of G. Blumer, E. Hoffer, T. Garr and the rational basis for the mobilization of D. Gupt. The methodological basis of the study is the theory of collective action (Ch. Tilly), on the basis of which it is concluded that political mobilization is defined as a combination of institutional and social conditions that allow actors to rationally evaluate transaction costs and possible gains from mobilization actions. The analysis of the regional public policy system is based on the conclusions contained in the works of Yu.O. Gaivoronsky, S.I. Morozov, S.A. Pankratov. The empirical basis of the study is the public opinion polls of the Levada Center, expert and analytical materials on the state of protest activity of the Institute of Regional Expertise, as well as the results of monitoring data from Internet resources obtained with the direct participation of the authors in March 2020. Analysis. The modern Russian socio-political system is a synthesis of two opposites: a hermetically "closed" institutional political structure, which is determined by the situation of internal uncertainty, and an active social component. At the same time, the specifics of the regional public space of Volgograd Region is a combination of the subject composition of the institutional design of the regional political regime based on copying the features of the federal regime, as well as the diversity of the regional themes of socio-political protest. Based on the results obtained by the case-study method, it was found that the protest dynamics in Volgograd region show a downward trend, however, any manifestations of public protest activity in the region implicitly imply a political nature in direct proportion to the number of participants: the greater the number of participants in the protest stocks, the higher the degree of its politicization. Results. According to the results of the study, it was revealed that the protest political mobilization in the public space of Volgograd region is characterized by: firstly, the prevalence of regional problems over federal ones in the protest discourse; secondly, the lack of strong institutional structures that can mobilize material and organizational resources; thirdly, a critically low number of protesters; fourthly, the spontaneous nature of mobilization. A special feature of political mobilization in the regional dimension is the low social potential of the protest and the lack of effective mechanisms for political and communicative interaction between government institutions and the population of Volgograd region on a specific range of problems of a public nature. In order to overcome the shortcomings of dialogue communication, within the framework of representative democracy, the authors propose recommendations for the main actors of the public political space (regional authorities, expert community and civil society institutions).},

	abstract = {This essay reframes street photography in terms of the images and videos taken by bystanders who find themselves witness to egregious acts of state-sanctioned police violence against black and brown bodies in the United States. Along the way, it challenges the belief that bystanders are "innocent" observers and investigates the meaning of "evidence" and the role of representation in order to argue for a model of seeing that can simultaneously reveal moments of ongoing racial debilitation and work to create new political subjects capable of transformative collective action. The goal is twofold: (1) to disrupt a history of photography-and more specifically a history of street photography-that emphasizes innovation, biography, and universal experience; and (2) to reorient what it means to discuss the politics of the image (in particular, the digital "documentary" image) away from a discourse that either privileges "uncertainty" or understands images as empty simulations, and toward one that acknowledges representation's complexity but also its ongoing power. In the United States, we may never be able to tell a story in and about public space without replaying scenes of violence and targeted assault, but this essay argues that finding ways to let voices and images from the past-both tragic and redemptive-resonate in the present and speak to us in the future, may provide some way forward.},

Today Total Dictation is held in 81 countries of the world. The author reviews Total Dictation not only as a tool strengthening positions of Russian literary language but also as a mechanism developing readers' taste to author's text and popularization of contemporary native writers. Secondary texts, so-called reposts take a significant place in reading of a present-day reader. That is why author's works created particularly for Total Dictation by masters of words are especially important for participants due to first-hand view of the world and uniqueness of creative writing. The aim of the research is to analyze the proposed for dictation fictional formats as an integral message to the world. Context of a dialogue known beforehand gives a chance to Russian writers to openly declare their own attitude, think of the fate of the language and people directly addressing participants of the project. It is this primacy, spontaneity and confidence that become an important value to the people living today in the world of secondary and more and more intermediate no-address messages. Content and format of the project are arranged in such a way that out of respect for the Russian language emerges understanding of deep ties of a man with history and culture, with soil and destiny of Russia. This idea is clearly and expressly articulated by modern native writers in the texts of dictations, which become part of a serious talk about Man's destiny and a reminder of inviolability of the nation' cultural code. Ever-increasing magnitude of this annual event in Russia and abroad, interest in it of the general public point to the fact that voluntary testing literacy campaign, which emerged on the initiative of NSTU - NETI students and professors turned today into a big cultural and educational project based on the interest and responsible attitude of the people to their mother tongue. As for the social movement itself, which brought together writers, critics, philologists, journalists, volonteers and Total Dictation participants, it has become the authoritative source of professional judgments about artistic creativity and the factor with a significant impact on building up literary reputation of modern writers. Emergence and development of such projects demonstrate an important and essential trend demanded by society of today of turning a human-being from a consumer of cultural values into an active participant of cultural processes.},

As interest groups have been traditionally a pro-immigrant party due to the economic benefits immigration brings to certain sectors of business, notably the agricultural and high technology industries, it has remained at odds with the moderately anti-immigrant U.S. public for many years. Recently, however, these two previously divergent entities have been converging into a pro-immigrant (in aggregate) position as the public grew more favorable of immigration in recent years. In this light, we trace this convergence of public opinion and interest group lobbying and then examine how the Trump administration has disrupted this seemingly harmonious trend in order to push through a series of anti-immigration policies that in essence represent the minority view in the United States. We further show how the growing polarization between the anti- and pro-immigrant public created an opening for Trump to exploit: capturing just enough support to win the election regardless of general public sentiment and interest group lobbying.},

On the one hand, if our lifestyle causes environmental harm, then we have a duty to reduce that impact through lifestyle changes (lifestyle-matters intuition). On the other hand, many people share the intuition that environmental duties cannot demand to alter our lifestyle radically for environmental reasons. These two intuitions underlie the current dualism in the environmental duties debate: those arguing for lifestyle changes (private duties) and those arguing that our duties are limited to promoting just environmental institutions (promotional duties). The paper has two goals: first, to grasp the underlying reasons for the two intuitions, and, second, to provide a proposal that integrates both intuitions. The paper consists of two main parts. The first part examines the 'our-duties-should-be-limited' intuition. Two interpretations are discussed, one under the title 'what I do make no difference', dealing with causality and collective action, and one under the title 'my duty cannot be to change my lifestyle completely', which discusses demandingness, fairness and value conflict. The second part shows how the 'lifestyle-matters' intuition can still play an important role. This part consists of two sections, one on 'how to make a difference', which deals with the idea of a cooperative ethos, and the other with 'why lifestyle matters', discussing expressive rationality and integrity. These ideas allow giving an important place to lifestyle duties, while avoiding the possible counterproductive effect of a private duties account.},

How and why has this form of welfare provision emerged as an urban institution, and what affects whether it endures? This article compares projects to grant poor and unemployed Chicagoans access to land for gardens and small farms between 1895 and 1935, explaining how this form of social support came about through experiments with rules, norms, and forms of property. While social policy is typically understood as emerging through the realization of rights to public support, use-based welfare turns instead on efforts to create a legal privilege for the needy to use idle resources. During the Progressive Era and the Great Depression, this form of relief was pitched as both an alternative and a complement to welfare based on tax and transfer. Yet efforts to establish it as a permanent institution repeatedly failed, due to implementation challenges, opposition from people committed to treating land and food as commodities, and the nonemergence of a social movement to defend land access. Recognizing the historical dynamics of use-based welfare offers a new perspective on the contemporary resurgence of urban farming as a strategy for addressing unemployment and poverty.},

In-depth interviews reveal that ESPA was constrained by the class and personal interests of its affluent major donors, mainly high-income gay white men. The organization's abrupt closure provided an unusual opportunity to research the often secret topic of major donor influence, as frustrated former staff were willing to be frank in interviews. ESPA was only able to successfully campaign on issues that were especially compelling for these donors, and was forced to close when its legislative agenda diverged from their interests.

In the 16th century early twenties German public opinion responded primarily to the exoteric component of Theses. Theological discussions stimulated the formation of the ideology of the All German anti-papist protest. Society came to a state of euphoria, which after the civil (Peasant) war, the brutal suppression of the peasant uprising and the exacerbation of territorial infighting, gave way to a paralyzing disappointment. In the formative years of the German Lutheran Church, its leader came close to recognizing the promulgation of Theses as a tragic mistake. However, at this historical period, the Reformation entered a new phase, declared itself as a pan-European social movement, united by a network of international contacts. The authority of Theses and all the theology of young Luther has been revived. The most relevant at that historical point were their deep, esoteric meanings.},

	abstract = {Legal and sociolegal scholars have argued that social movement litigation often generates social change indirectly by drawing publicity and public attention to movement issues. Yet some cases are more likely than others to receive coverage in the mainstream news media particularly those cases involving conflict or controversy, which resonate with established definitions of "newsworthiness." This Article empirically examines bias in the news media's coverage of social movement litigation through a case study of the LGBT movement, which compares the content of the litigation dockets of three major LGBT civil rights organizations to the content of newspaper coverage of those organizations from 1996-2006. The time period examined in this study offers a unique opportunity to investigate bias in media coverage of movement litigation. This period marks the formative first decade after LGBT rights organizations began to take part in litigation for marriage equality, an issue which has since become an essential part of the LGBT movement's public narrative. As movement litigators during these years tentatively asserted the right for same-sex couples to marry in a few select state courts, they were met with an intense conservative backlash targeting both same-sex marriage as a goal and the impact litigation strategies being used to achieve it. In examining LGBT movement litigation during this period of intense controversy around same -sex marriage, this Article illuminates the role of countermovements in shaping media constructions and broader popular interpretations of social movement litigation. Findings from the study reveal that the news media reported more extensively on the LGBT movement's marriage equality litigation than on any other issue. This coverage was drastically disproportionate to the small percentage of marriage equality cases on the LGBT legal organizations' dockets during this time period. In addition, news articles on same-sex marriage litigation were significantly more likely than other articles to discuss anti-LGBT countermovement activity. These findings suggest that countermovement mobilization against same-sex marriage, dubbed a "culture war" in the media, may have created conflict that reporters found particularly newsworthy leading the news media to focus attention on one of the LGBT movement's most contentious litigation campaigns. I explore the implications of these findings in shaping the course of social movement mobilization, countermobilization, and the possibilities for social change.},

We found that affiliation with Extension has a strong impact on the willingness to pay for Extension programs. Thus, we provide evidence that supports the argument that Extension is an important service and an appropriate use of public funds for economic development. This finding is in line with Elinor Ostrom's theory in new institutional economics that well-designed, robust local entities that stimulate local participation can assist in managing natural resources.},

This article examines the case of the Great Railway Adventure, a series of protests in England organized by the Craftivist Collective and Climate Rush incorporating feminine dress, craftwork, and food. It analyzes the success of these elements in generating media attention and the role the elements play in news media's framing of the protests. By employing a qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles, I found that the elements were able to achieve limited levels of media attention through novelty and situational irony when combined with more standard elements of direct action campaigning. These elements also shaped the content of many but not all of the news articles.},

However, such research often ignores a more fundamental first step in this process: the generation of movement support. I address this gap by drawing on a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States - who either sympathised with or opposed anti-immigration activism - to identify individual attributes differentiating anti-immigration movement supporters and non-supporters. Perceptions of economic threat, waning confidence in political leadership, and prejudicial cultural beliefs about Latinos represent attributes differentiated movement supporters from non-supporters. Power devaluation theory is used as an overarching framework to meaningfully interpret these results. More generally, I argue that grievances play an important, yet under theorised role in jumpstarting conservative micromobilisation and that principles from power devaluation theory can help us understand the differentiation of movement support, irrespective of a social movement's political orientation.},

	title = {Predictive approach to environmental health policies in {France}},
	volume = {6},
	issn = {1635-0421},
	abstract = {During the 1990s, research activities to characterise environmental health risks grew significantly in France, providing useful tools for policy-makers in this field. Research into the management of these risks also exists, but is neither coherent on a national scale nor sufficient to deal with the issues created by the accelerated production of potentially anxiety-inducing scientific information. This article focuses on the study of public policies in environmental health and is intended to contribute to development of knowledge in this domain. Reviewing explanatory approaches to the construction of public risk management policies reveals three broad categories: "type of risk" or technical approaches that focus on ways to transform scientific knowledge into decision tools; "public preferences and attitudes' approaches, which suggest that risk management policies are determined (or should be) by public demands; and "interest group" approaches arguing that risk regimes are the product of the influences of various organised interests. Christopher Hood has developed a method to assess the relative weight of these approaches in actual risk regulation regimes, depending on situations and types of risks, and to analyse these regimes and compare those expected for each approach. We apply this method to French risk management policies for three risks - waterborne lead, exposure to Legionella in hotels, and exposure to asbestos in buildings. Conclusions of this explanatory exercise are consistent with Hood's findings and point out the major relevance of the "interest groups" model, except in the area of asbestos, for which anticipation of public opinion seems to dominate. This exercise, although it may lack robustness, deserves further development to improve our understanding of the construction of environmental health policies.},

That the passions and interests of real people often divert them from pursuing the common good confronted them with a dilemma: what is desired by all is not necessarily what reason shows to be in their general interest. The dilemma points to the necessity of government and also of institutional arrangements to mediate between the people and the makers of laws binding on everyone. The paper examines in particular the views of Rousseau on assemblies, of Hegel on the development of universal norms, and of von Stein on social movement. It concludes that public opinion exists only in the form of discourse and that it exerts influence either when some part acts as a concrete group or when the preferences of an abstract aggregate of individuals converge on a particular party, candidate, or legislative proposal.},

These models establish two components of Senators' ideology through a regression of constituency demographics on interest group ratings. The predicted scores are constituency attitudes while the residuals are Senators' personal ideologies. Senators' personal ideology is presumed to be independent of constituency factors. The use of demographics is problematic, because it is unclear that they are good surrogates for attitudes. Using statewide estimates of ideology from public opinion surveys, I show that demographics provide reasonable estimates of public attitudes. However, estimates of shirking from public opinion depend upon constituency characteristics, a finding that is inconsistent with shirking models based upon residualization. The existing shirking models depend heavily upon a legislator's party as a key component of constituency opinion. But party is an attribute of the Senator and not of the electorate. A better interpretation is that Senators respond to their fellow partisans in the electorate.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Nas últimas duas décadas, os estudiosos dos movimentos sociais passaram a questionar as fronteiras do seu campo de pesquisa. Alguns defenderam a substituição do conceito de "movimentos sociais" por "sociedade civil", enquanto outros propuseram falar de "política do conflito". Em ambos os casos, argumentou-se que o campo de estudos havia se tornado excessivamente limitado, tanto empírica como teoricamente. O artigo discute essas iniciativas e identifica um problema comum: a falta de atenção dada às numerosas formas de interação entre ativistas de movimentos sociais situados dentro e fora do Estado. Argumentamos que a pesquisa empírica que vem sendo realizada no Brasil ajuda a compreender melhor a relação entre Estado e movimentos sociais. Do ponto de vista teórico, é a literatura recente sobre redes sociais que oferece pistas analíticas sobre como pensar no ativismo a partir de dentro das estruturas do Estado.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Resumo O presente artigo aborda a questão da unidade e diversidade dos movimentos sociais. O objetivo foi apresentar a diferença entre movimentos sociais em geral e movimentos sociais específicos. Para concretizar esse objetivo, lançamos mão do método dialético e suas categorias analíticas. A análise da unidade dos movimentos sociais remeteu para a reflexão sobre o seu conceito, pois este é o elemento que permite entender a essência dos mesmos. O passo seguinte foi mostrar que existe uma diversidade no interior dessa unidade e que ela se manifesta através do movimento específico de cada grupo social em sua relação com a totalidade da sociedade moderna. Esse processo analítico foi complementado pela análise crítica de algumas definições e problemas nas abordagens dos movimentos sociais em geral e específicos. A conclusão geral é a de que é necessário um conceito de movimentos sociais que consiga dar conta da unidade e diversidade desse fenômeno, tal como o que foi apresentado no artigo, e que este momento precisa ser complementado pela análise da diversidade, o que remente para o caso dos movimentos sociais específicos.

Questioning the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon the social psychology of social movement participants; it can then be more easily integrated with structural theories of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to explain social movement activity at several levels of inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social movement industry, and social movement organization.},

We argue that contentious events associated with the women's movement provide informational cues that prime the public. This process then leads to changes in attitudes regarding gender. We use quarterly time series data on contentious events of the U.S. women's movement ranging from 1960 to 1992 and public opinion about gender attitudes in the United States to examine whether public opinion moves in response to social movement events. Using an error correction model, we demonstrate that social movement events have a significant effect on gender attitudes. Citizens adopt more liberal gender attitudes as the U.S. women's movement increases its activity. These results suggest that social movement scholars should be paying more attention to public opinion when assessing the outcomes of social movements.},

Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6–2.5\%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward “social control.” In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9\% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election.

We take stock of this research with a focus on movements in democratic polities and the United States in comparative and historical perspective. Although most studies demonstrate the influence of the largest movements, this research has not addressed how much movements matter. As for the conditions under which movements matter, scholars have been revising their initial hypotheses that the strategies, organizational forms, and political contexts that aid mobilization also aid in gaining and exerting political influence. Scholars are exploring alternative arguments about the productivity of different actions and characteristics of movements and movement organizations in the varied political contexts and institutional settings they face. Researchers are also employing more innovative research designs to appraise these more complex arguments. Scholarship will advance best if scholars continue to think through the interactions between strategies, organizations, and contexts; address movement influences on processes in institutional politics beyond the agenda-setting stage; situate case studies in comparative and historical perspective; and make more comparisons across movements and issues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This media discourse, it is argued, is an essential context for understanding the formation of public opinion on nuclear power. More specifically, it helps to account for such survey results as the decline in support for nuclear power before Three Mile Island, a rebound after a burst of media publicity has died out, the gap between general support for nuclear power and support for a plant in one's own community, and the changed relationship of age to support for nuclear power from 1950 to the present.},

We then examine the sources of support for these organizations, highlighting the influence of benefactor organizations on SMO viability and tactics. Employing qualitative comparative analysis, we identify three resource configurations among the viable SMOs and find that certain resource types contributed more than others to viability. Support from benefactors also ensured viability of these organizations without moderating their tactics. We explain the implications of these findings for understanding the roles that resources and sponsorship or patronage play in the careers of SMOs and the relevance of resources, sponsorship, and organization to social movements of the poor.]},

Even those factors adduced to correct some of the problems of the political opportunity approach–such as "mobilizing structures" and "cultural framing"–are subject to the same structural distortions. We recommend social movement analysis that rejects invariant modeling, is wary of conceptual stretching, and recognizes the diverse ways that culture and agency, including emotions and strategizing, shape collective action.]},

El artículo indaga las condiciones del contexto nacional y los factores individuales que explican las protestas pacíficas en la región. Tras examinar las teorías e investigaciones previas sobre las protestas en el mundo, el trabajo contrasta las principales hipótesis causales en el caso latinoamericano desarrollando modelos de regresión lineal jerárquica o multinivel a partir de datos de la encuesta Latinobarómetro y otros indicadores políticos, económicos y sociales de 18 países de la región. El principal impulsor individual del activismo pacífico es el interés por la política, seguido por un \&lt;em\&gt;proxy\&lt;/em\&gt; de valores emancipatorios y el nivel educativo. Los niveles de desarrollo y democracia del país y el grado en que los valores mencionados están difundidos en la sociedad aumentan el activismo y amplifican el impacto de esos impulsores individuales. El uso de redes sociales ejerce un influjo relevante. Por sí sola, la insatisfacción personal y política tiene efectos débiles o no significativos. Las protestas pacíficas de los latinoamericanos reflejan el ascenso de ciudadanos empoderados y más exigentes, a medida que el desarrollo económico y humano avanza en la región. Lejos de perturbar la democracia, este proceso tiende a profundizarla.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

	abstract = {A análise das relações entre estruturas e processos socieconômicos e estruturas legais tem sido efetuada a partir de duas perspectivas opostas: por um lado, temos a perspectiva jurídicoformal, que dominou durante muito tempo a sociologia de muitos países latino-americanos e, por outro, o sociologismo quase puro. O prisma jurídico-formal caracterizou um período em que a sociologia não estava profissionalizada, sendo uma atividade diletante realizada geralmente por advogados. Este ponto de vista, com freqüência, misturava conceitos de valor e de realidade, às vezes atribuindo ao real aquelas qualidades que deveriam existir de acordo com a norma. Em alguns países latino-americanos ainda predomina este tipo de enfoque, que caracteriza uma situação na qual a sociologia ainda não existe de direito próprio como ciência autônoma, negando-se a legitimidade da profissão de sociólogo. Em algumas partes do Brasil, persiste ainda hoje esta situação, embora em outras, mais modernas, as ciências humanas já se encontrem profissionalizadas. Não obstante, mesmo nas regiões mais desenvolvidas, observamos incursões freqüentes de profissionais de outras áreas, principalmente daqueles de mais idade...},

	abstract = {Firm-level data from executives are necessary for testing many theories in organizational science. To date, researchers who have used survey methods to get data from executives have relied on response-rate techniques that were validated in general public, customer-, or employee-level populations. In a factorial field experiment, we manipulated the four most strongly supported of these techniques: incentives (gifts), advance notice, follow-up, and personalization. We also examined firm size as a potential moderator of their effects. In addition, we tested whether these response-rate enhancements affected the psychometric quality (acquiescence, self-presentation bias) of the executive survey data. Despite high statistical power (n = 1,200, 1 − β ≥ .95), none of the conventional response-rate enhancement techniques were effective. Small influences on response acquiescence were found but these were confined to questions that arguably had the strongest demand cues. We conclude that distinctly different techniques may be needed to generate interest and involvement among executives targeted by firm-level mail surveys, and we provide some suggestions.},

They found mean response rates to be declining over the period, yielding an overall 32\% rate. Of the various methods suggested to increase response rates in other populations, none were found to be effective for executives. However, topical salience and sponsorship by an organization or person in the executive's social networks did bring about response rate increases.

	abstract = {Response representativeness is more important than response rate in survey research. However, response rate is important if it bears on representativeness. The present meta-analysis explores factors associated with higher response rates in electronic surveys reported in both published and unpublished research. The number of contacts, per-sonalized contacts, and precontacts are the factors most associated with higher response rates in the Web studies that are analyzed. During each election cycle, we are bombarded with the results of national polls updating us on the views of millions of potential voters. These surveys are usually based on responses of only an infinitesimal proportion (e.g., 2,000/ 150,000,000 = 0.000013) of the total population. Yet these portrayals are often stunningly accurate. Election polls make clear that the representativeness of our samples is much more important than the response rate we obtain. A sample of fewer than 1\% of the population can be more representative, indeed much more representative , than a sample of 50\% or 60\% of the population. Thus Krosnick (1999) emphasized in his recent survey of the paper-and-pencil response-rate literature, But it is not necessarily true that representativeness increases monotonically with increasing response rate. .. recent research has shown that surveys with very low response rates can be more accurate than surveys with much higher response rates. (p. 540) Nevertheless, we remain concerned about our response rates if we are uncertain with regard to sample representativeness. We know that ultimately, if},

The CIG-survey includes surveys among national populations of organized interests in 9 European countries and at the European Union level. Although surveys are a useful and reliable way to collect data on a variety of topics, there are also numerous pitfalls and challenges in surveying interest groups, especially across multiple countries. Despite the prominent use of surveys in interest group research, systematic reflections on this method are scarce and data sets are not always properly archived or openly accessible. This article elaborates upon the practical implications and reflects on the lessons learnt during from the implementation of the CIG-survey. Moreover, we highlight how the fuzzy boundaries of interest communities obfuscate sampling and that surveying interest organizations requires researchers to navigate through a specific organizational context to reach and motivate respondents. We also demonstrate how a careful survey plan can positively affect response rates and enable the creation of robust comparative data sets.},

	abstract = {Este é um livro escrito para apoiar a aprendizagem de Amostragem. Nosso objetivo principal é orientar um leitor no caminho para aprender os conceitos, as principais ideias e a usar as ferramentas de amostragem para resolver problemas.

Nossa escolha de temas a incluir no livro foi guiada, em grande parte, por nossa experiência com a coleção de pesquisas por amostragem do IBGE, onde trabalhamos por vários anos, e nossa atuação como professores na graduação e na pós graduação da ENCE. Também reflete nossa perspectiva quanto ao melhor caminho para aprender a trabalhar com Amostragem.

Nossa abordagem não busca ser exaustiva e, por esse motivo, são poucas as provas que incluímos dos resultados aqui discutidos. Fizemos a escolha deliberada de não apresentar demonstrações da maioria dos resultados relacionados a valor esperado e variância de estimadores. Essas demonstrações podem intimidar e afastar alguns e, além disso, cremos que estão bem cobertas em diversos outros livros sobre o tema. Aos leitores interessados em verificar os resultados, recomendamos a consulta ao excelente livro de Särndal et al. (1992) ou então às muitas referências incluídas ao longo do texto.

Em contraste, escolhemos enfatizar a apresentação de exemplos e de ferramentas computacionais, algo que não tem cobertura tão ampla na literatura sobre Amostragem. Nesse contexto, optamos também por enfatizar o uso de comandos ou recursos básicos do R, em lugar de pacotes mais avançados que estão disponíveis.

O livro está organizado em treze capítulos, nominados a seguir:

Introdução
Conceitos e Cadastros
Visão Geral da Amostragem e Estimação
Amostragem Aleatória Simples
Estimação de Proporções
Estimação de Razões e Funções de Totais
Estimação para Domínios de Estudo
Amostragem Sistemática Simples
Outros Métodos de Amostragem com Equiprobabilidade
Amostragem com Probabilidades Proporcionais ao Tamanho
Amostragem Estratificada
Amostragem Conglomerada
Estimadores de Calibração
Cada um dos capítulos é autocontido e vários deles podem ser omitidos num primeiro curso. Com exceção do Capítulo 13, o material do livro pode ser coberto num curso com cerca de 45 horas de duração, como ministrado várias vezes na pós-graduação da ENCE. Caso necessário, algum(ns) dos Capítulos 5, 6 ou 7 pode(m) ser suprimidos ou separados para estudo individual. Os Capítulos 8 e 9 podem ser omitidos sem prejuízo da sequência. O conteúdo central do livro é formado por todos os capítulos não citados neste parágrafo. Tal conteúdo formaria, a nosso ver, o mínimo para cobertura num primeiro curso, no nível de graduação, sobre Amostragem.

Nossa opção ao escolher essa forma de publicação (livro em formato de hipertexto, hospedado na internet) se deve a três fatores principais: primeiro, não pretendemos comercializar o livro e, sim, torná-lo de acesso livre e aberto, como é a filosofia do software que usamos para sua elaboração e produção (R + RStudio + R Markdown + Github); segundo, essa forma de publicação permitirá atualizações mais rápidas e frequentes do conteúdo, o que favorece a correção de erros, revisões do texto, inclusão de exemplos ou tópicos novos etc.; terceiro, podemos usar esse caminho disponibilizar os dados que usamos para exemplos e exercícios. Esperamos que essa escolha não afaste os leitores que ainda gostam de livros em papel, como nós…

O leitor de qualquer livro precisa reconhecer que não é possível começar do zero: é preciso contar com conhecimento prévio de algumas ideias e conceitos básicos essenciais à compreensão do material tratado. Nossa abordagem pressupõe que o leitor está familiarizado com um curso básico de introdução à probabilidade e à inferência estatística, no nível tratado, por exemplo, em Magalhães e Lima (2004) e Magalhães (2006).},

	abstract = {Since the 1960s Juan J. Linz has been one of the world's foremost contributors to our understanding of democracy, authoritarianism, and totalitarianism. Although many of his contributions have had a significant impact, few have been as far-reaching as his essay "Presidential or Parliamentary Democracy: Does It Make a Difference?," originally written in 1985. The essay argued that presidentialism is less likely than parliamentarism to sustain stable democratic regimes. It became a classic even in unpublished form. Among both policymakers and scholars it spawned a broad debate about the merits and especially the liabilities of presidential government. Now that the definitive version of the essay has appeared, we believe that a critical appraisal is timely. This task is especially important because Linz's arguments against presidentialism have gained widespread currency. This article critically assesses Linz's arguments about the perils of presidential-ism. Although we agree with several of Linz's criticisms of presidentialism, we disagree that presidentialism is particularly oriented towards winner-takes-all results.' We argue that the superior record of parliamentary systems has rested partly on where parliamentary government has been implemented, and we claim that presi-dentialism has some advantages that partially offset its drawbacks. These advantages can be maximized by paying careful attention to differences among presidential systems. Other things being equal, presidentialism tends to function better where presidencies have weak legislative powers, parties are at least moderately disciplined, and party systems are not highly fragmented. Finally, we argue that switching from presidentialism to parliamentarism could exacerbate problems of governability in countries with undisciplined parties. Even if parliamentary government is more conducive to stable democracy, much rests on what kind of parliamentarism and presi-dentialism is implemented.2 By presidentialism we mean a regime in which, first, the president is always the chief executive and is elected by popular vote or, as in the U.S., by an electoral college with essentially no autonomy with respect to popular preferences and, second, the terms of office for the president and the assembly are fixed. Under pure presi-dentialism the president has the right to retain ministers of his or her choosing regardless of the composition of the congress. 449},

We hold that one long-term outcome of radical social movements is the ability to alter discursive fields through mechanisms such as increasing the salience and content of movement-based issues. We examine the way movements shape discourse by focusing on newspaper articles about inequality before, during, and after the Occupy Wall Street (OWS) movement. We analyze changes in the salience and content of coverage as well as shifts in actor standing and influence. Using 7,024 articles from eight newspapers, we find that the OWS movement increased media attention to inequality, shifting the focus of the discourse toward movement-based issue areas (e.g., the middle class and minimum wage). Further, we find that compared to the pre-OWS period, the influence of social movement organizations and think tanks rose in discourse on inequality. In addition, the discourse on inequality became more highly politicized as a result of the Occupy movement.

This supportive public opinion provides a valuable resource for the environmental movement, and the future of the movement will depend heavily on the degree to which environmentalists can effectively mobilize this support.},

	abstract = {Abstract A comprehensive review of available longitudinal data on public opinion toward environmental issues since 1965 suggests the following conclusions regarding trends in public concern over environmental quality: (a) Environmental concern developed dramatically in the late 1960s and reached a peak with the first Earth Day in 1970; (b) such concern declined considerably in the early 1970s and then more gradually over the rest of the decade, but remained substantial; (c) the 1980s saw a significant and steady increase in both public awareness of the seriousness of environmental problems and in support for environmental protection, with the result that by the twentieth anniversary of Earth Day in 1990, public concern for environmental quality reached unprecedented levels. This supportive public opinion provides a valuable resource for the environmental movement, and the future of the movement will depend heavily on the degree to which environmentalists can effectively mobilize this support.},

In fact, social movement scholars have devoted little attention to the concept of civil society, not even when addressing issues of “social capital”. Vice versa, civil society scholars have, with few exceptions, not considered social movements as cognate phenomena. This is all the more puzzling as there is instead ample theoretical and empirical overlapping, which calls for the building of bridges between these fields of study.

In particular, social movement studies can contribute to the literature on voluntarism a toolkit of concepts and theory oriented to understand social and political conflicts, learning from the literature on voluntarism about conceptions and practices of solidarity. In this article, I will address some (potential) interactions between the two fields, looking at differences and similarities in the conceptualizations of the two phenomena as well as in their empirical analysis as they have developed in time. I will first of all address conceptualizations in these cognate fields with attention to their theoretical developments. Then, I will point towards some recent trends that have blurred the distinction between social movements and civil society, voluntarism and third sector policies, looking in particular not only at more established analyses of NGOization of social movements, but also, and especially, of what can be defined as an SMOization of civil society—that is, the hybridization of more established civil society organizations into social movement organizations, especially when facing politicization in times of crises and increasing criminalization of solidarity activities.},

I hypothesize: (1) that people have a variety of needs which are given high or low priority according to their degree of fulfillment: people act on behalf of their most important unsatisfied need, giving relatively little attention to needs already satisfied—except that (2) people tend to retain the value priorities adopted in their formative years throughout adult life. In contemporary Western Europe, needs for physical safety and economic security are relatively well satisfied for an unprecedentedly large share of the population. Younger, more affluent groups have been formed entirely under these conditions, and seem relatively likely to give top priority to fulfillment of needs which remain secondary to the older and less affluent majority of the population. Needs for belonging and intellectual and esthetic self-fulfillment (characterized as “post-bourgeois” values) may take top priorities among the former group. Survey data from six countries indicate that the value priorities of the more affluent postwar group do contrast with those of groups raised under conditions of lesser economic and physical security. National patterns of value priorities correspond to the given nation's economic history, moreover, suggesting that the age-group differences reflect the persistence of preadult experiences, rather than life cycle effects. The distinctive value priorities imply distinctive political behavior—being empirically linked with preferences for specific political issues and political parties in a predictable fashion. If the respective age cohorts retain their present value priorities, we would expect long-term shifts in the political goals and patterns of political partisanship prevailing in these societies.},

We manipulated whether or not the scientist expressed values and whether the scientist’s conclusion appeared contrary to or consistent with the scientist’s values, and we accounted for whether or not subjects’ values aligned with the scientist’s values. We analyzed our data with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression techniques. Our results provide at least preliminary evidence that acknowledging values may reduce the perceived credibility of scientists within the general public, but this effect differs depending on whether scientists and citizens share values, whether scientists draw conclusions that run contrary to their values, and whether scientists make policy recommendations.},

In addition, the link between feminist self-identification and some social attitudes is cohort specific: Seemingly profeminist positions distinguish self-identified feminists from nonfeminists only among members of the "second-wave" generation.

	abstract = {[Using the 1996 General Social Survey, the antecedents of feminist self-identification and their link to gender-related social attitudes are explored. Although most socio-demographic variables show either no relationship or a weak relationship with feminist self-identification, there are strong differences across cohorts. Males and females who were young adults during the "second wave" of feminism (birth years 1936 to 1955) are more likely to identify as feminists than are those younger or older. In addition, the link between feminist self-identification and some social attitudes is cohort specific: Seemingly profeminist positions distinguish self-identified feminists from nonfeminists only among members of the "second-wave" generation. These results reinforce the importance of political generation and suggest increasing heterogeneity in public conceptions of feminism.]},

	title = {Estágios para universitários : representações e implicações na inserção profissional dos jovens brasileiros e franceses},
	abstract = {Currently, there is noticeable growth in the number of internships for university students, which constitute an important complement to their education. This strategy has been used in various countries as means of reducing the difficulties encountered by young people attempting to enter the job market. However, students have experienced difficulty finding job opportunities given the economic situation and the crisis within the contraction system that has led to the existence of ever more precarious jobs at all levels of society, above all among young people that aim to enter the current labor market. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to understand the representations of university students regarding the internship experience and their implications for their entry into professional life within the current socio-economic context in Brazil and France. For this purpose a constructivist approach is taken in order to explore the theory to show how the concepts have been formed over time while a path is sought that allows it to be understood as a phenomenon that is constructed within social relations. For the purpose of the research, a documentary search was carried out (articles, guide books, laws and decrees) and 32 French and 31 Brazilian students were interviewed, which were analyzed using discursive practices (SPINK, 2004). In Brazil, the interns are receiving central attention from the State, which, in 2008, approved a new law for their guidance, which recommends the central role of the universities and attributes to students rights similar to those held by workers. In practice, analysis of the interviews shows that interns represent a market which incorporates several aspects similar to those of the labor market, such as the selection methods, requested requirements, tasks performed and responsibilities assumed by the interns, as well as a series of dysfunctions that give it a precarious character. Amidst these conditions, the representations that emerge show the interns to be closer to a relationship of labor than to one of teaching. Given the variety of paths built based on the internship experience, the students establish insertion routes (formal employment, accelerated development, entrepreneurship, public employment and academic career) that they hope to follow. In France, while there have also been changes to the labor market, the teaching institutions act to ensure, at least in part, the educational character of the internships. The French internship market is regulated by the institution to which the student is linked, which may or may not closely accompany the situation. The organizations, though they have extended the demands for, above all, technical and behavioral competences, at times linked to prior experience, have for the most part, treated internship as an educational period. Within this scenario the representations that emerge are linked to the idea of professional insertion and the risk of precariousness associated with this route. Of the career expectations, for the majority formal employment route stands out while for some it is the search for a high management position.},

	abstract = {The present dissertation starts from the perspective of the deep connection between space and gender. In an unequal society there is no space whose occupation, distribution and signification is not unequal, and inequality has many faces. The materiality of the patriarchal oppression-exploitation system in urban space and the repercussion of gender inequality in access to the urban system are fundamental elements for the intended reflection. The production of space dominated by capitalism determines a habitat, whose appropriation by individuals fixed in social positions that accumulate vulnerability and precariousness is unequal. Unequal access to the urban system related to the accumulation of vulnerabilities determines a reciprocal process in which the possible place and the lived space legitimize and reinforce each other. Unequal spatial development has a material and symbolic repercussion in everyday life in a multidimensional process involving complex and relational indicators. The Women’s Homeownership Guideline establishes a link between issues pertaining to popular housing and gender inequality, highlighting the connection between gender relations, the production of space and the unequal pattern of access to the city of women and men. This reflection therefore includes the discussion about access to the city in the face of the accumulation of distinctions that define the possible place as socially oppressed, politically invisible and economically vulnerable, with the perspective of apprehending the transformative potential of the Women’s Homeownership Guideline in the face of the complexity of gender inequalities of space production in capitalism},

	abstract = {For decades our common understanding of the organization of economic production has been that individuals order their productive activities in one of two ways: either as employees in firms, following the directions of managers, or as individuals in markets, following price signals. This dichotomy was first identified in the early work of Ronald Coase and was developed most explicitly in the work of institutional economist Oliver Williamson. Recently, public attention has focused on a fifteen-year-old phenomenon called free software or open source software. This phenomenon involves thousands, or even tens of thousands, of computer programmers who collaborate on large- and small-scale projects without traditional firm-based or market-based ownership of the resulting product. This Article explains why free software is only one example of a much broader social-economic phenomenon emerging in the digitally networked. environment, a third mode of production that the author calls "commons-based peer production." The Article begins by demonstrating the widespread use of commons-based peer production on the Internet through a number of detailed examples, such as Wikipedia, Slashdot the Open Directory Project, and Google. The Article uses these examples to reveal fundamental characteristics of commons-based peer production that distinguish it from the property- and contract-based modes of firms and markets. The central distinguishing characteristic. is that groups of individuals successfully collaborate on large-scale projects following a diverse cluster of motivational drives and social signals rather than market prices or managerial commands. The Article then explains why this mode has systematic advantages over markets and managerial hierarchies in the digitally networked environment when the object of production is information or culture. First, peer production has an advantage in what the author calls "information opportunity cost," because it loses less information about who might be the best person for a given job. Second, there are substantial increasing allocation gains to be captured from allowing large clusters of potential contributors to interact with large clusters of information resources in search of new projects and opportunities for collaboration.

	volume = {89},
	issn = {0040-4411},
	abstract = {So-called independent agencies are created for a reason, and often that reason is a concern with agency capture. Agency designers hope that a more insulated agency will better protect the general public interest against interest group pressure. But the conventional approach to independent agencies in administrative law largely ignores why agencies are insulated. Instead, discussions about independent agencies in administrative law have focused on three features that have defined independent agencies: heads who are removable for cause by the President, an exemption from having to submit regulations to the President's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for cost-benefit analysis, and a multimember structure. But these traditional characteristics of an independent agency are not the only, or necessarily even the most effective, ways in which insulation from interest groups and partisan pressure can be achieved. In fact, under modern conditions of political oversight, other design elements and mechanisms are often just as important if the goal is to create an agency that is best suited to achieve a long-term public-interest mission free from capture. This is particularly true of agencies tasked with protecting the general public in the face of one-sided and intense political pressure. This kind of lopsided pressure can be seen in a range of areas, from criminal justice to consumer protection. The goal of this Article is to move the conversation about insulation beyond the traditional hallmarks of independence and identify overlooked elements of agency design, deemed "equalizing factors," that are particularly well-suited to addressing the problem of capture in the context of asymmetrical political pressure. The Article identifies five such equalizing factors that have received little or no attention in the legal literature on independent agencies but that are critically important for insulation against one-sided interest group dominance. The Article then compares the effectiveness of traditional and equalizing factors in the context of consumer protection, an area with the kind of one-sided interest group pressure that is a breeding ground for capture. The Article explores the relationship between the institutional design of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and its effectiveness and uses those lessons to analyze the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, the most significant new federal agency created in decades. This analysis of consumer protection regulatory agencies showcases both the continuing danger of capture and the critical importance of institutional design in policing it.},

Citizens living in societies with a high degree of social cohesion - characterized by strong social networks and high levels of interpersonal trust seem to be healthier than those living in socially disorganized societies. Epidemiologists have become interested in notions of civil society and social capital to explain variations in health across societies. The purpose of the present paper was to examine the role of social capital in the Russian mortality crisis. Social capital has been defined as those features of social organization - such as the density of civic associations, levels of interpersonal trust, and norms of reciprocity - that act as resources for individuals, and facilitate collective action. A civil society is one that is rich in stocks of social capital. Various scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Soviet regime was the paucity of civil society. Using household survey data from the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion research (VTsIOM), we carried out a cross-sectional, ecologic analysis of the association between indicators of social capital and mortality rates across 40 regions of Russia. We found associations between indicators of social capital (mistrust in government, crime, quality of work relations, civic engagement in politics) and life expectancy, as well as mortality rates. In the absence of civil society, it is believed that far more people in post-Soviet Russia rely on informal sources of support (friends, family) to deal with their day to day problems. Those lacking such sources of support may have been especially vulnerable to the economic hardships following the transformation to a market economy. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

By including both issue areas that are salient to the Latino community (immigration, bilingual education) as well as those that are not directly tied to Latinos (abortion, death penalty), I test the primary hypothesis that group consciousness has a greater impact on Latino political attitudes across issues that are directly tied to ethnicity than on those that are not. Results from this analysis support the overall theory, as perceived discrimination motivates public opinion toward both immigration and bilingual education, and collective action toward immigration. Among other factors, nativity and the length of time lived in the U.S. have the greatest influence on Latino public opinion.},

	abstract = {The public opinion of the Latino community is an understudied area within the political science literature. This analysis contributes to this literature by investigating the role of group consciousness across both Latino salient and general policy areas utilizing the 1999 Washington Post/Henryj. Kaiser Family Foundation National Survey of Latinos. By including both issue areas that are salient to the Latino community (immigration, bilingual education) as well as those that are not directly tied to Latinos (abortion, death penalty), I test the primary hypothesis that group consciousness has a greater impact on Latino political attitudes across issues that are directly tied to ethnicity than on those that are not. Results from this analysis support the overall theory, as perceived discrimination motivates public opinion toward both immigration and bilingual education, and collective action toward immigration. Among other factors, nativity and the length of time lived in the U.S. have the greatest influence on Latino public opinion.},

The benefits of risk reduction also fall primarily upon future generations, while uncertainties mean that differences in perspective, and problems of poor communication, misinformation and unstated assumptions tend to cloud the social discourse.},

Results of all three studies indicate that modern sexism is less likely to be perceived as a form of discrimination, and as a result elicits less anger at the source and less support for collective action (Study 1), intentions to protest (Study 2), and collective protest behavior (Study 3) than old-fashioned sexism.

They constitute the corporate version of grassroots social movements. Serious ethical and societal concerns underline this astroturfing practice, especially if corporations are successful in influencing public opinion by undertaking a social movement approach. This study is motivated by this particular issue and examines the effectiveness of astroturf organizations in the global warming context, wherein large corporate polluters have an incentive to set up astroturf organizations to undermine the importance of human activities in climate change. We conduct an experiment to determine whether astroturf organizations have an impact on the level of user certainty about the causes of global warming. Results show that people who used astroturf websites became more uncertain about the causes of global warming and humans' role in the phenomenon than people who used grassroots websites. Astroturf organizations are hence successful in promoting business interests over environmental protection. In addition to the multiple business ethics issues it raises, astroturfing poses a significant threat to the legitimacy of the grassroots movement.},

	abstract = {Astroturf organizations are fake grassroots organizations usually sponsored by large corporations to support any arguments or claims in their favor, or to challenge and deny those against them. They constitute the corporate version of grassroots social movements. Serious ethical and societal concerns underline this astroturfing practice, especially if corporations are successful in influencing public opinion by undertaking a social movement approach. This study is motivated by this particular issue and examines the effectiveness of astroturf organizations in the global warming context, wherein large corporate polluters have an incentive to set up astroturf organizations to undermine the importance of human activities in climate change. We conduct an experiment to determine whether astroturf organizations have an impact on the level of user certainty about the causes of global warming. Results show that people who used astroturf websites became more uncertain about the causes of global warming and humans' role in the phenomenon than people who used grassroots websites. Astroturf organizations are hence successful in promoting business interests over environmental protection. In addition to the multiple business ethics issues it raises, astroturfing poses a significant threat to the legitimacy of the grassroots movement.},

While these processes imply dynamic connections among political actors, researchers often cannot observe such interdependence. One example is public policy diffusion, which has long been a focus of multiple subfields. In the American state politics context, diffusion is commonly conceptualized as a dyadic process whereby states adopt policies (in part) because other states have adopted them. This implies a policy diffusion network connecting the states. Using a dataset of 187 policies, we introduce and apply an algorithm that infers this network from persistent diffusion patterns. The results contribute to knowledge on state policy diffusion in several respects. Additionally, in introducing network inference to political science, we provide scholars across the discipline with a general framework for empirically recovering the latent and dynamic interdependence among political actors.},

	abstract = {The transmission of ideas, information, and resources forms the core of many issues studied in political science, including collective action, cooperation, and development. While these processes imply dynamic connections among political actors, researchers often cannot observe such interdependence. One example is public policy diffusion, which has long been a focus of multiple subfields. In the American state politics context, diffusion is commonly conceptualized as a dyadic process whereby states adopt policies (in part) because other states have adopted them. This implies a policy diffusion network connecting the states. Using a dataset of 187 policies, we introduce and apply an algorithm that infers this network from persistent diffusion patterns. The results contribute to knowledge on state policy diffusion in several respects. Additionally, in introducing network inference to political science, we provide scholars across the discipline with a general framework for empirically recovering the latent and dynamic interdependence among political actors.},

In the United States, however, a competing model has gained empirical support in which partisanship is defined as an identity that is largely defensive in nature and not especially reactive to ongoing events.

In this review, we focus on several European democracies (the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy) and evaluate evidence for and against an expressive model of partisanship in which democratic citizens act to defend their party in order to maintain its positive standing. We find evidence that strong partisans in Europe exhibit five characteristics of expressive partisans: stable partisan identity, motivated reasoning in defense of the party, the greater influence of identity than issues and ideology in shaping vote choice and political behavior, affective polarization bias in favor of one's own party, and the existence of strong defensive emotions aroused by partisan threats and reassurances. It appears that partisans in the four European democracies act in similar ways to partisans in the United States.

However, whereas psychological research on intrapersonal and some group-level processes (e.g., political polarization of climate beliefs) has flourished, research into other social processessuch as an understanding of how nonpartisan social identities, cultural ideologies, and group hierarchies shape public engagement on climate changehas received substantially less attention. In this article, we take stock of current psychological approaches to the study of climate change to explore what is social about climate change from the perspective of psychology. Drawing from current interdisciplinary perspectives and emerging empirical findings within psychology, we identify four distinct features of climate change and three sets of psychological processes evoked by these features that are fundamentally social and shape both individual and group responses to climate change. Finally, we consider how a more nuanced understanding of the social underpinnings of climate change can stimulate new questions and advance theory within psychology.},

However, whereas psychological research on intrapersonal and some group-level processes (e.g., political polarization of climate beliefs) has flourished, research into other social processessuch as an understanding of how nonpartisan social identities, cultural ideologies, and group hierarchies shape public engagement on climate changehas received substantially less attention. In this article, we take stock of current psychological approaches to the study of climate change to explore what is social about climate change from the perspective of psychology. Drawing from current interdisciplinary perspectives and emerging empirical findings within psychology, we identify four distinct features of climate change and three sets of psychological processes evoked by these features that are fundamentally social and shape both individual and group responses to climate change. Finally, we consider how a more nuanced understanding of the social underpinnings of climate change can stimulate new questions and advance theory within psychology.},

Finally, we examine the presumed bases of support for environmental protection and other NSMs, particularly the notion that NSM supporters are drawn heavily from the "new class."

While previous research has investigated the text content of news media coverage of obesity, these studies have tended to ignore the photographs and other images that accompany obesity-related news coverage. Images can convey important messages about which groups in society are more or less affected by a health problem, and, in turn, shape public understanding about the social epidemiology of that condition. In this study, we analyzed the images of overweight and obese individuals in Time and Newsweek coverage over a 25-year period (1984-2009), and compared these depictions, which we characterize as representing the "news media epidemiology" of obesity, to data describing the true national prevalence of obesity within key populations of interest over this period. Data collected included descriptive features of news stories and accompanying images, and demographic characteristics of individuals portrayed in images. Over the 25-year period, we found that news magazines increasingly depicted non-whites as overweight and obese, and showed overweight and obese individuals less often performing stereotypical behaviors. Even with increasing representation of non-whites over time, news magazines still underrepresented African Americans and Latinos. In addition, the elderly were starkly underrepresented in images of the overweight and obese compared to actual prevalence rates. Research in other policy arenas has linked media depictions of the populations affected by social problems with public support for policies to combat them. Further research is needed to understand how news media depictions can affect public stigma toward overweight and obese individuals and public support for obesity prevention efforts.

	abstract = {Do policy elites invoke public opinion? When they do, are their claims based on evidence from public opinion surveys? To learn about the claims that policy elites make, we examined statements the president and members of Congress, experts, and interest group leaders in congressional hearings made about Social Security. To learn about opinion data on Social Security, we conducted a Lexis-Nexis search of the archives of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Our analyses show that policy elites discussing Social Security did invoke public opinion. Contrary to our expectations, however, few of the elite invocations of public opinion cited specific surveys or concrete facts about the distribution of opinion. Although claims directly contradicting survey evidence were relatively rare, only with the rather few specific claims by congressional elites did we find much clear-cut support in the available polling data. Relatively seldom could we find clear-cut support for the elites' general claims. Moreover, some of the most frequent claims about public opinion-including the UFO story and alleged public support for privatization-could have been contested but seldom were. The highly visible and well-polled case of Social Security suggests that specific, data-based elite invocations of public opinion may be even less common on other, lower-visibility and less-polled issues. It also suggests that survey research professionals might do well to intensify their scrutiny of public discourse about public opinion and to increase their efforts to bring scientific expertise to bear upon such discourse.},

	abstract = {Do policy elites invoke public opinion? When they do, are their claims based on evidence from public opinion surveys? To learn about the claims that policy elites make, we examined statements the president and members of Congress, experts, and interest group leaders in congressional hearings made about Social Security. To learn about opinion data on Social Security, we conducted a Lexis-Nexis search of the archives of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Our analyses show that policy elites discussing Social Security did invoke public opinion. Contrary to our expectations, however, few of the elite invocations of public opinion cited specific surveys or concrete facts about the distribution of opinion. Although claims directly contradicting survey evidence were relatively rare, only with the rather few specific claims by congressional elites did we find much clear-cut support in the available polling data. Relatively seldom could we find clear-cut support for the elites' general claims. Moreover, some of the most frequent claims about public opinion-including the UFO story and alleged public support for privatization-could have been contested but seldom were. The highly visible and well-polled case of Social Security suggests that specific, data-based elite invocations of public opinion may be even less common on other, lower-visibility and less-polled issues. It also suggests that survey research professionals might do well to intensify their scrutiny of public discourse about public opinion and to increase their efforts to bring scientific expertise to bear upon such discourse.},

The paper aims to make two contributions to the Dialectic Issue LifeCycle (DILC) model, which captures the dynamics of socio-political mobilization around societal problems and industry responses. First, the five phases in the DILC-model are elaborated with insights from social movement theory, political science, public attention, issue management, corporate political strategy, and innovation management. Second, a 'cyclical' lifecycle pattern is explored, in which a social problem does not linearly progress through successive phases, but can also move 'backwards' if public attention or political will decrease. We explore these contributions with a longitudinal study of the car-safety problem and responses from American automakers (1900-1995). We use a combined quantitative qualitative method that employs coupled time-series analyses as support for an in-depth case study. The case study showed that the industry long denied the influence of car design on fatalities, and reluctantly changed its position in the mid-1960s (under pressure from public opinion and policy-makers).

In developing their model, the authors draw on research on people in disasters and collective behavior. In keeping with these traditions, they argue that, when faced with emergent social threats, members of society seek to clarify ambiguous and often conflicting information about such threats through affiliation. The process through which ambiguous social information gets interpreted closely resembles the ways in which social movements arrive at interpretive frames that ready participants for action. Thus, whether or not a social object becomes deviantized depends on a complex process of social construction involving active, not merely reactive, efforts by social actors (contrary to traditional images of "panic").},

	abstract = {In this paper, the authors call into question the idea of moral panic and delineate the rudiments of an alternate model of deviance construction and moral public discourse, using LSD prohibition as a working example. In developing their model, the authors draw on research on people in disasters and collective behavior. In keeping with these traditions, they argue that, when faced with emergent social threats, members of society seek to clarify ambiguous and often conflicting information about such threats through affiliation. The process through which ambiguous social information gets interpreted closely resembles the ways in which social movements arrive at interpretive frames that ready participants for action. Thus, whether or not a social object becomes deviantized depends on a complex process of social construction involving active, not merely reactive, efforts by social actors (contrary to traditional images of "panic").},

While there is one Roman Catholic church, with a diverse membership but unified leadership and doctrine on the abortion issue, there are many conservative Protestant churches with no unified leadership.

Under this frame, a large contiguous surface involving numerous owners is subject to a single management plan, providing an opportunity for cooperation. Since 2005, 161 zones have been created but only half of them have had their management plan approved and very few are nearing its implementation. Cooperation amongst private forest owners has usually been explained at the owner level. In an approach at the local level we examine local constraints and key-factors for cooperative landscape management. Building on the theory of collective action, a typology of FIZ/territories is established by Cluster Analysis using a group of ecological and socioeconomic variables expressing the characteristics of natural resources, owners' group, institutional arrangements, and external environment of FIZs. Three clusters are identified. Where FIZs are smaller and biophysical resources impose greater wildfire susceptibility, the transaction costs for collective management are highest due to more numerous, aged, and dispersed owners and the absence of a land registry. Conversely, larger FIZs have fewer owners, more powerful management bodies, and higher public financial incentives, leading to greater performance rate. Nonetheless, since their resources are less fire-prone, and private profitability is higher, public support for collective action has a lower social return. Addressing the heterogeneity of local systems of ecological and socioeconomic constraints is therefore a challenge faced by public policy makers seeking to mitigate wildfire risk.

We contend that these two distinct efficacy judgments are tied to community integration and media use, yet have very different consequences for political participation. Specifically, we predict that when actual citizen efficacy falls to meet expectations, people will tend to favor more individual forms of political participation over collective efforts. Using data from a random digit dialing community survey, this research finds: (i) that evaluations of desired citizen efficacy are conceptually different from evaluations of actual citizen efficacy; (2) that demographics, community integration, and mass media use significantly predict both types of efficacy-but do so differently; and (3) that the efficacy gap positively predicts individual forms of political participation and negatively predicts collective action.},

	abstract = {A range of factors may contribute to a sense that citizens are less able to influence public policy and engage in self-governance than should ideally be the case, yet research has rarely considered the distinction between citizens' judgments of how much influence they do have, how much they ought to have, and how the gap between these two perceptions affects various modes of participation. We contend that these two distinct efficacy judgments are tied to community integration and media use, yet have very different consequences for political participation. Specifically, we predict that when actual citizen efficacy falls to meet expectations, people will tend to favor more individual forms of political participation over collective efforts. Using data from a random digit dialing community survey, this research finds: (i) that evaluations of desired citizen efficacy are conceptually different from evaluations of actual citizen efficacy; (2) that demographics, community integration, and mass media use significantly predict both types of efficacy-but do so differently; and (3) that the efficacy gap positively predicts individual forms of political participation and negatively predicts collective action.},

Policy-makers look to respond to the public mood on migration, but face growing constraints in doing so. The interaction of public opinion, policy and constraint has produced three distinct policy regimes. In the first, from 1982 to 1997, policy-makers faced few constraints, immigration was tightly controlled and the public were unconcerned about the issue. In the second, from 1997 to 2004, migration policy was selectively liberalised in response to external and interest group pressures, producing increasing inflows and growing public demands for restriction. In the third, from 2004 to the time of writing, public demand for restriction is strong but policy-makers face significant constraints in responding. In all periods, policy-makers seek to focus restriction on the migrant streams most opposed by the public, but as they have lost discretionary power over the issue they have been forced to take action against more economically valuable and socially accepted migrant streams. The growing constraints on policy-makers have therefore sharpened the trade-off between the responsive' government of meeting public demands for immigrations restriction and the responsible' government goal of providing for the needs of a flexible, globally integrated economy.},

In this article we examine how two well-documented, relatively successful and longstanding initiatives, the Orangi Pilot Project and an Alliance of Indian partners, met these challenges. They were met through social innovation, but also through the choice and development of sanitation technologies (simplified sewers for OPP and community toilet blocks for the Indian Alliance) that provided traction for the social innovations. We also explore more recent efforts by civil society partnerships in four African cities, demonstrating some of the difficulties they have faced in trying to overcome these challenges. No equivalent models have emerged, though there has been considerable progress against particular challenges in particular places. These findings confirm the importance of the challenges, and indicate that these are not just challenges for social organization, but also for technology design and choice. For example, the problem with household pit latrines is not that they cannot physically be improved to sufficiently, but that they are not well-suited to the social, economic and political challenges of sanitary improvement at scale. The findings also indicate that a low economic status and a tendency to treat sanitation as a private good not suitable for public support also makes the sanitation challenges difficult to overcome.

Through a large-scale (N = 5000) randomized survey experiment with a 2 x 3 factorial design, the extent to which perceptions of fairness determine attitudes to a suggested increase of the Swedish CO2 tax is explored.

The results show that a higher tax increase is both viewed as more unfair and enjoys weaker support. Furthermore, compensatory measures can be a powerful policy design tool to increase perceptions of the policy as fair, but the effect of compensation on policy support is conditioned by the individual's left-right ideological position.

The results show that hostile media perceptions have a direct association with climate activism that is conditioned by political ideology: Among liberals, hostile media perceptions promote activism, whereas among conservatives, they decrease activism. Hostile media perceptions also have a negative, indirect relationship with activism that is mediated through external political efficacy; however, this relationship is conditioned by both ideology and internal political efficacy. Specifically, the indirect effect manifests exclusively among conservatives and moderates who have low internal efficacy. Theoretical, normative, and practical implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective Recent research suggests that a gun owner social identity may undergird the deep political engagement of U.S. gun rights supporters. We adapt social psychological measures to assess whether such an identity does indeed exist, examine the factors that predict whether individuals hold the identity, and assess whether the identity predicts individuals' political attitudes and participation. Methods We analyze two distinct survey data sets using various statistical techniques: (1) an original Mechanical Turk survey and (2) a survey of gun owners conducted by the Pew Research Center. Results Gun owner identity is an individual characteristic that can be meaningfully measured. Moreover, gun owner identity is predicted by contact with the National Rifle Association and participation in gun-related social activities, among other factors. Further, this identity strongly predicts firearm-related policy attitudes, the importance individuals place upon these issues, and their propensity to act in opposition to gun regulations, all independent of gun ownership. Conclusions Our results suggest that nuanced measurement of gun owner identity can provide a richer understanding of gun policy attitudes, identity politics, and interest group influence. In so doing, they help explain gun rights supporters' unusual dedication and, by extension, the NRA's success in the realm of gun policy.},

	abstract = {Objective Recent research suggests that a gun owner social identity may undergird the deep political engagement of U.S. gun rights supporters. We adapt social psychological measures to assess whether such an identity does indeed exist, examine the factors that predict whether individuals hold the identity, and assess whether the identity predicts individuals' political attitudes and participation. Methods We analyze two distinct survey data sets using various statistical techniques: (1) an original Mechanical Turk survey and (2) a survey of gun owners conducted by the Pew Research Center. Results Gun owner identity is an individual characteristic that can be meaningfully measured. Moreover, gun owner identity is predicted by contact with the National Rifle Association and participation in gun-related social activities, among other factors. Further, this identity strongly predicts firearm-related policy attitudes, the importance individuals place upon these issues, and their propensity to act in opposition to gun regulations, all independent of gun ownership. Conclusions Our results suggest that nuanced measurement of gun owner identity can provide a richer understanding of gun policy attitudes, identity politics, and interest group influence. In so doing, they help explain gun rights supporters' unusual dedication and, by extension, the NRA's success in the realm of gun policy.},

These activists placed women's rights in the mainstream public discourse by drawing the media's attention to their "performance art". This study compares the intergenerational differences between China's first generation of women's NGOs, which were mostly founded or flourished in the wake of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, and a new generation that burst on the scene in 2012. The study argues that their main differences lie in their mobilization models and their ability to access key political resources, both of which were heavily influenced, and even decided, by their relationship with the state. Moreover, the change in the relationship between the state and feminist movements is reflected in the differences in the relationship with the media of the two generations of feminist movements. Because of the differences in their organizational models, resource conditions, and status, the two generations of feminists adopted different media strategies in their promotion of women's rights. Using the "performance art" of the " Occupy Men's Toilet" campaign as an example, we examine the media strategies employed by young feminists and illustrate how they legitimated the movements, aroused public attention, imposed pressure from the outside, and finally gained policy responses from the government. The study proposes the tripartite relationship between the state, media, and the two generations of the women's movement in China, and concludes that the relationship between media and the women's movements examined here was influenced and even decided by their respective relationships with the state.},

We show that in a "Big Data" world, the comments posted online by social media users can profitably be used to extract meaningful information, which can support the action of policymakers along the policy cycle. We analyze Twitter data through the technique of Supervised Aggregated Sentiment Analysis. We develop two case studies related to the "jobs act" labor market reform and the "\#labuonascuola" school reform, both formulated and implemented by the Italian Renzi cabinet in 2014-15. Our results demonstrate that social media data can help policymakers to rate the available policy alternatives according to citizens' preferences during the formulation phase of a public policy; can help them to monitor citizens' opinions during the implementation phase; and capture stakeholders' mobilization and de-mobilization processes. We argue that, although social media analysis cannot replace other research methods, it provides a fast and cheap stream of information that can supplement traditional analyses, enhancing responsiveness and institutional learning.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the potential role played by social media analysis in promoting interaction between politicians, bureaucrats, and citizens. We show that in a "Big Data" world, the comments posted online by social media users can profitably be used to extract meaningful information, which can support the action of policymakers along the policy cycle. We analyze Twitter data through the technique of Supervised Aggregated Sentiment Analysis. We develop two case studies related to the "jobs act" labor market reform and the "\#labuonascuola" school reform, both formulated and implemented by the Italian Renzi cabinet in 2014-15. Our results demonstrate that social media data can help policymakers to rate the available policy alternatives according to citizens' preferences during the formulation phase of a public policy; can help them to monitor citizens' opinions during the implementation phase; and capture stakeholders' mobilization and de-mobilization processes. We argue that, although social media analysis cannot replace other research methods, it provides a fast and cheap stream of information that can supplement traditional analyses, enhancing responsiveness and institutional learning.},

Measures of perceived effectiveness of the Occupy movement to achieve successful outcomes (i.e. its ability to influence public opinion, strengthen the pro-democracy cause in Hong Kong, and facilitate opinion expression) explained additional variance even after controlling for demographics and the core antecedents.

We found that people are more willing to speak out on social media when their perceived social support enhances perceived sense of power/control through their opinion congruency with others' online comments. The findings suggest that individuals' perceived sense of power serves as an underlying mechanism that accounts for why people share their opinions in a social media setting.

We tested the mediation effect of perceived social support, influencing the sense of power/control and in turn affecting their willingness to share opinions on their personal Social Networking Sites. We found that people are more willing to speak out on social media when their perceived social support enhances perceived sense of power/control through their opinion congruency with others' online comments. The findings suggest that individuals' perceived sense of power serves as an underlying mechanism that accounts for why people share their opinions in a social media setting. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed in the study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Purpose: This study evaluates the quality of balance promoting apps and identifies strengths and areas of concern to assist healthcare providers in recommending these resources. Materials and methods: Balance apps for the general public, offered on the iPhone Operating System (iOS) and Android platforms, were evaluated using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS).

Overall, one app (UStabilize) received a rating of 4.43 in MARS five-point scale, which was considered "good". Other apps in the review demonstrated acceptable quality. Conclusions: The reviewed balance apps targeted to improve or maintain physical balance were of acceptable quality.

This makes it impossible to measure the contribution of individual resource managers to the provision of these services, as is the case in landscapes managed by private landowners such as farmers. As a consequence, the magnitude of the public support associated with the implementation of a policy cannot be specified down to the level of the individual manager/land owner.

This paper proposes a financial compensation arrangement among resource managers in a landscape, based on the Kaldor-Hicks criterion leading to a Pareto-optimal improvement, and explores the institutional requirements for the effective implementation of this arrangement. The proposed arrangement is illustrated with a case study in a woodland landscape in The Netherlands. The results show that private benefits among farms differed considerably due to biophysical, ecological and geographic differences among the farms. The financial compensation arrangement could contribute to improved equity among natural resource managers, which has been proposed as a key requirement for implementation of effective governance of environmental changes.

	abstract = {While vaccine-critical activism has been widely documented and discussed, comparatively little has been said about the concerted response of pro-vaccine activists defending the majority view. This paper explores two case studies of pro-vaccine activism in Australia and the United States (US). It shows how pro-vaccine views and behaviours can take varying forms due to different aims and methods of engagement - oppositional counter-activities in favour of vaccination in Australia, and issue-based advocacy as part of a political alliance in the US. The focus in Australia comes from a pro-science stance and includes 'skeptics' against pseudoscience directly opposing vaccine-critical groups. In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study - of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination - can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups.},

In the US, the focus takes the form of an issue-specific campaign that has arisen from existing pro-vaccine parent blogs and discussion groups pushing for policy change rather than public confrontation. These case studies exemplify how pro-vaccine activism can take varying forms of either reinforcing the mainstream view or countering digression from it. Drawing on qualitative research, this paper aims to examine the types of practices and strategies employed by activists to voice their support of vaccination, and discusses the means, messages, and motivations of pro-vaccine activism. It ends with an argument for why a study - of public support for in addition to studying public opposition to vaccination - can help to better understand vaccination views and behaviours. These findings have wider implications for the study of counter-activism and the polarisation of civil society groups.},

An analysis of newspaper coverage suggests that flawed convictions, in which possibly innocent persons either suffer or narrowly escape execution, are especially potent threats to public support for capital punishment. The paper concludes by stressing the centrality of social movement organizations and the media in transforming underpublicized or affect-neutral events into suddenly realized grievances.},

The structural equation modeling results suggest that one's connections with others, including socializing with relatives and friends as well as general social networking, are significantly and positively related to various dimensions of environmental concern. Greater trust is positively related to one's willingness to make sacrifices for the benefit of the environment but is also negatively related to perceived dangerousness of pollution.

By obscuring its own role in this effort, the tobacco industry undermined the public's reasonable expectations for transparency in the policy-making process. Aim: To examine the formation and activities of the Consumer Tax Alliance as a "hybrid” form of interest group in order to provide tobacco control and public health advocates with a better understanding of unanticipated tobacco industry coalitions and facilitate appropriate countermeasures. Methods: Document searches through the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library and through Tobacco Documents Online and review of background literature. Results: The Tobacco Institute actively sought liberal allies beginning in the mid-1980s in seeking to build public opposition to cigarette excise tax increases by promoting them as a regressive form of taxation. The creation of the Consumer Tax Alliance in 1989 was expressly intended to turn labour and middle-class opinion against prospective excise tax increases in federal budget deficit negotiations, without divulging the tobacco industry's role in its formation. Conclusion: It is important to understand the dynamic by which trusted organisations can be induced to alter their agendas in response to funding sources.

Using survey responses from approximately 1800 Swedish college students, different trust measures were found to have different links to attitudes to state intervention: trust in public administration is a stable predictor of EPI support, whereas distrust in business actors generates stronger support for punishing instruments. We also found that preferences for push policies are associated with a willingness to punish, whereas preferences for pull policies are associated with a willingness to reward.

Most of these attempts focus on false content and/or bad actors detection. In this paper, we argue for a wider ecological focus. Using the frame of media manipulation and a revised version of the 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' original definition, the paper presents a study based on an unprecedented combination of Facebook data, accessed through the CrowdTangle API, and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election. By focusing on actors' collective behavior, we identified several networks of pages, groups, and verified public profiles ('entities'), that shared the same political news articles on Facebook within a very short period of time. Some entities in our networks were openly political, while others, despite sharing political content too, deceptively presented themselves as entertainment venues. The proportion of inauthentic entities in a network affects the wideness of the range of news media sources they shared, thus pointing to different strategies and possible motivations. The paper has both theoretical and empirical implications: it frames the concept of 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' in existing literature, introduces a method to detect coordinated link sharing behavior and points out different strategies and methods employed by networks of actors willing to manipulate the media and public opinion.},

The article questions how specific temporal regimes enable or complicate protestors' efforts to gain public legitimacy. A large body of research suggests that it is difficult to gain such legitimacy in the mainstream news cycle, in which protest is primarily covered from an 'episodic' perspective, ignoring larger protest issues. The present analysis suggests that despite the participatory affordances of social media, it has not become any easier to generate sustained public attention for structural protest issues. Drawing examples from three case studies, it demonstrates that the dominant mode of social media protest communication reproduces and reinforces the episodic focus of the mainstream news.

Although unremarkable in the sense that a breakdown in norms of interdependence is a defining characteristic of contemporary politics, I regard the current situation involving the federal judiciary as remarkably dangerous because of the possibility that a tipping point of no return to the traditional equilibrium in interbranch relations may be reached. That prospect is suggested by the insight that our "tradition of judicial independence" has depended critically on the public's support of the courts irrespective of the decisions they make ("diffuse support"), and by research that provides reason to fear that the distinction between diffuse support and support depending on those decisions ("specific support") will disappear, leading people to ask of the judiciary not, "What does the law require?, " but rather, "What have you done for me lately?" I then turn to how, in the conduct of interbranch relations, the judiciary should respond to the impulses and incentives, both legitimate and illegitimate, that have brought us to this unhappy point. I conclude that successful interbranch relations require the institutional judiciary to avoid the attitudes and techniques of contemporary politics, but not to avoid politics, and that the main challenge in that regard is to avoid the perception that the federal judiciary is just another interest group. Finally, using the writings and career of the late Richard Arnold to exemplify what is needed in the politics of judging as well as the politics of the judiciary, I argue for judges to provide leadership in a return to norms of custom, dialogue, and statesmanship in interbranch relations. In order to do so, more federal judges will need to follow Arnold's example in recognizing that a presidential commission does not confer moral superiority; that judicial accountability, properly conceived, is essential for judicial independence; and that both 'posterity worship" (the attempt to control the future) and institutional aggrandizement are inimical to the long-term interests of the federal courts and the federal judiciary.},

	abstract = {The literature on nonprofit management has embraced the concept of "accountability" to target urgent challenges related to NGO probity and integrity, and there have been attempts in the literature to use rational-choice-based governance approaches to solve them. Although the existing principal-agent frameworks provide important insights, they are limited to the analysis of financial relationships between NGOs and donors.

Three experiments (Ns = 95, 213, 220), involving a novel paradigm (`the shared media paradigm') test the role of bystander emotional responses (anger/amusement) in shaping action to confront disparagement humor, through emotion-based social influence. Study 1 demonstrates that bystander action to confront disparagement humor as prejudice is shaped by the angry (but not amused) responses of co-present others. Study 2 considers a moderator of the influence process: the role of one's own emotional reaction to disparagement humor (angry/amused). Bystander confrontation was more intense when one's own angry reaction was validated by that of other bystanders but there was otherwise mixed evidence that the two interacted to promote collaboration/confrontation. Study 3 tests the claim that disparagement humor is especially challenging to confront because humor disarms opposition.

In this paper, we take synchronization evolution phenomenon as an objective and adopt artificial bee colony (ABC) to evaluate network synchronization effects with optimization theory to find out an appropriate network structure. Firstly, we use the Kuramoto oscillators as a metaphor of the social system collective behavior. Secondly, combined with the social network characteristics obtained from the data of Sina Micro-Blog, a synchronization evolution model of Internet public opinion based on Kuramoto one is established. Subsequently, evolutionary multi-objective optimization model is set up and the ABC method is used to optimize the level of network synchronization, the synchronization starting time and the cost of public opinion synchronization. Finally, case analysis on "Double Eleven" Internet Marketing as well as Cadmium Poisoned Rice Event demonstrates that the synchronization performance of weak coupled system can be enhanced by offering reasonable configuration of the connection cost and the synchronization duration cost. In addition, a certain degree of increase in input cost can promote the synchronization performance and extend the synchronization duration significantly.},

	abstract = {Today, the public opinion synchronization on the network platform is becoming one of important issues worthy of careful study. In this paper, we take synchronization evolution phenomenon as an objective and adopt artificial bee colony (ABC) to evaluate network synchronization effects with optimization theory to find out an appropriate network structure. Firstly, we use the Kuramoto oscillators as a metaphor of the social system collective behavior. Secondly, combined with the social network characteristics obtained from the data of Sina Micro-Blog, a synchronization evolution model of Internet public opinion based on Kuramoto one is established. Subsequently, evolutionary multi-objective optimization model is set up and the ABC method is used to optimize the level of network synchronization, the synchronization starting time and the cost of public opinion synchronization. Finally, case analysis on "Double Eleven" Internet Marketing as well as Cadmium Poisoned Rice Event demonstrates that the synchronization performance of weak coupled system can be enhanced by offering reasonable configuration of the connection cost and the synchronization duration cost. In addition, a certain degree of increase in input cost can promote the synchronization performance and extend the synchronization duration significantly.},

By comparing respondents interviewed before and after the riots, it finds that the street violence episode reduced support for the 15-M movement by 12 percentage points on average. However, the magnitude of the effect is highly conditional on the respondents' predispositions towards the movement. Core supporters, that are expected to share the frame of the movement in justifying violent actions, are the least affected by the violent outbreak. On the other extreme, weak supporters, opposers, and non-aligned citizens reduce their support to a larger extent.

This study examines the factors that explain the ongoing participation of individuals in the environmental movement (more broadly, beyond participation in civil disobedience) to protect Clayoquot Sound during the period following the 1993 protest. We focus on the roles of interpersonal social networks and movement identification, and compare their statistical effects with the effects of values and attitudes on the level of participation of individuals in the movement. We compare survey data from members of Friends of Clayoquot Sound (FOCS), a key environmental organization in this protest, with data collected from several surveys of the general public, and also from members of a local countermovement group (a proforest industry group that mobilized against the environmental movement). Although values and attitudes statistically differentiate members of FOCS from the other groups, these variables do not statistically explain ongoing differential participation in the movement amongst FOCS members. Rather, individual level of participation in this environmental movement is best explained by ego-network centrality (the pattern of ties each respondent has to contacts in the movement), as measured by the number of ties FOCS members have to others in a range of environmental organizations, and by their level of identification with the movement. Implications of this research for more recent mobilizations, such as against oil pipelines, are discussed, as are avenues for future research.},

These factors fall into three categories: underlying structural changes in Congress and the interest group community that created a receptive climate for addressing health care reform; more immediate changes in the medical system, public opinion, media coverage, and the budgetary and political environments that increased attention to the issue; and a crucial political catalyst that thrust the issue to the top of the government agenda-the 1991 victory of Harris Wofford in a special Senate race in Pennsylvania.

This widely shared interpretation redefined the political risks and benefits of health care reform, creating an opportunity for legislative action.

	abstract = {The literature embraces several arguments regarding the influence of online communication platforms and practices on communicative, semantic, affective and organisational elements of citizen activism. Although organisational matters are inherent in most discussions in this area, there is a need for empirical insight into under-explored cases of citizen activism that can contribute toward addressing questions about the informal organisation of citizen activism and the associated role of social media. This paper presents an interview study of the role of Facebook in the informal organisation of the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan. The study found that participants in the Sunflower Movement engaged more with Facebook's information-spreading and information-sharing functions than with its networking affordances. They used these functions to enhance the public's engagement with the movement and recruit new participants, as well as to initiate, support and coordinate offline action. In addition, in the context of the Sunflower Movement, Facebook appeared to support the largely self-organised and loosely structured character of the coordination of offline action. It also fostered movement participants' actions and feelings of 'altruism' toward other participants as well as their desire to 'awaken' other groups and the public at large. Regarding leadership, the study shows that leadership structures still exist in technologically mediated citizen activism, but they are often challenged by activists, while decision-making is a lot more complex and multi-layered than in the past.},

	abstract = {The literature embraces several arguments regarding the influence of online communication platforms and practices on communicative, semantic, affective and organisational elements of citizen activism. Although organisational matters are inherent in most discussions in this area, there is a need for empirical insight into under-explored cases of citizen activism that can contribute toward addressing questions about the informal organisation of citizen activism and the associated role of social media. This paper presents an interview study of the role of Facebook in the informal organisation of the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan. The study found that participants in the Sunflower Movement engaged more with Facebook's information-spreading and information-sharing functions than with its networking affordances. They used these functions to enhance the public's engagement with the movement and recruit new participants, as well as to initiate, support and coordinate offline action. In addition, in the context of the Sunflower Movement, Facebook appeared to support the largely self-organised and loosely structured character of the coordination of offline action. It also fostered movement participants' actions and feelings of 'altruism' toward other participants as well as their desire to 'awaken' other groups and the public at large. Regarding leadership, the study shows that leadership structures still exist in technologically mediated citizen activism, but they are often challenged by activists, while decision-making is a lot more complex and multi-layered than in the past.},

Although it has become a global movement, to date, few studies have investigated the motivations behind people's participation in Earth Hour. The present study fills this gap by examining Earth Hour participation through the integration of the identity perspective and the theory of planned behavior (TPB). We argue that environmental self-identity and humanity identity motivate people to participate in Earth Hour via the pathways identified in the TPB. We tested our model by conducting a survey in Hong Kong (N = 239). Results from a series of mediation analysis revealed that Earth Hour-specific attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and moral norm were positively associated with behavioral intention, which in turn predicted actual participation. Further, we found that environmental self-identity and humanity identity were positively associated with attitude and moral norm, which in turn predicted behavioral intention. These results demonstrate the viability of integrating the identity perspective and the TPB to understand people's performance of specific pro-environmental behavior, including participation in collective action that aims to convert unconcerned individuals into active participants in environmental endeavors (i.e., conversionary collective action), such as Earth Hour. This integrated model can tell researchers and environmental practitioners not only which behavior-specific factors determine people's behavior but also how these behavior-specific factors arise in the first place.},

Here, we conduct a trend study to test the impacts of two back-to-back highly visible large-scale climate change related marches on bystanders, targeting psychological drivers of collective action: efficacy beliefs, perceptions of others' climate change activism and concerns, impressions of marchers, and behavioral intentions. Participants either completed a survey the day before the March for Science (n = 302) or several days after the People's Climate March, which occurred a week after the first march (n = 285). Results suggest that the marches were at least partially effective: bystanders' (a) collective efficacy beliefs and (b) impressions of marchers improved after the march. In contrast, marches were ineffective in increasing perceptions of others' engagement with concern about climate change. We anticipated that political leaning of bystanders' news sources would moderate effects of marches. Unexpectedly, collective efficacy beliefs improved among consumers of conservative, but not liberal, news. This unanticipated result is consistent with the notion that conservative news sources dedicated less coverage than liberal news sources to the marches prior to the marches (potentially leading to lower collective efficacy among those who consumed these sources), but that coverage afterwards was more equal across ideological bias of news sources. We also found that the more conservative the news sources consumed by an individual, the more negative impressions they had of marchers, and this relation was strongest among those that indicated, after the marches, that they had heard about the marches. These results on impressions are consistent with the notion that, when marches were covered, conservative news sources portrayed marchers relatively more negatively than liberal news sources.

We propose that within the context of Ukraine's intergroup conflict over the annexation of Crimea, supporters (but not opponents) of the "Euromaidan" social movement are likely to validate protesters' collective actions as just to the extent that they believe that the authorities are engaged in annexation-related conspiracies. We also examine the moderating role of perceived political corruption in these processes. Using a public opinion survey of 315 Ukrainians, we found support for our hypothesized moderated mediation model-identification with "Euromaidan" increased beliefs in the annexation-related conspiracy theories, which in turn, increased justification of protesters' actions in the setting of intergroup conflict. However, this mediation was only observed among those supporters of the Euromaidan who perceived political corruption to be at a low or average level.},

We propose that within the context of Ukraine's intergroup conflict over the annexation of Crimea, supporters (but not opponents) of the "Euromaidan" social movement are likely to validate protesters' collective actions as just to the extent that they believe that the authorities are engaged in annexation-related conspiracies. We also examine the moderating role of perceived political corruption in these processes. Using a public opinion survey of 315 Ukrainians, we found support for our hypothesized moderated mediation model-identification with "Euromaidan" increased beliefs in the annexation-related conspiracy theories, which in turn, increased justification of protesters' actions in the setting of intergroup conflict. However, this mediation was only observed among those supporters of the Euromaidan who perceived political corruption to be at a low or average level.},

	abstract = {A generative turn in scholarship examines the institutional and political dimensions of Islamophobia, conceptualizing Muslim representations as a mechanism of ethnoracial formation in which the media is one such site of racialization. Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies.

	abstract = {A generative turn in scholarship examines the institutional and political dimensions of Islamophobia, conceptualizing Muslim representations as a mechanism of ethnoracial formation in which the media is one such site of racialization. Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies. Prognostic frames shift from institutional reforms to those targeting group pathology. The author argues that excavating the latent mechanisms of racial projects helps us better understand the dynamic and ongoing processes of ethnoracial formation.},

Following recent criticisms of individual legal and moral responsibility for rape as a war crime in international law, this article examines how we might think of war rape as a collective action in moral and explanatory terms. First, it assesses existing moral arguments for the responsibility of men in groups for rape, primarily with reference to the work of Claudia Card, Larry May and Robert Strikwerda. Critiquing elements of these arguments, it explores the difficulties in talking about `men' as a coherent group and in discussing `collectives' themselves. Second, the article draws out the connection between accounts of moral responsibility and accounts of causal responsibility. Drawing on critiques of collective responsibility and the long-standing agency/structure problem, it argues that causal accounts focusing on structure pose a serious challenge to ideas of both individual and collective moral responsibility. The complexities of the relationship between moral and causal claims are illustrated through a discussion of Susan Brownmiller and Catharine MacKinnon's influential perspectives on rape. The seeming paradox of responsibility is emphasised as a problem to be addressed by gender and feminist perspectives that seek to pursue both ethical and explanatory inquiry into the workings of masculinity and the political means for undoing gendered wrongs.},

	issn = {0036-0465},
	abstract = {Governments tend to enforce vice laws-i.e., criminal laws targeting consensual but morally disreputable conduct-sporadically. Existing scholarship generally attributes this underenforcement strategy to a variety of case-specific factors, such as budgetary constraints, fluctuating public support, and interest-group pressures. The Author argues that governments generally underenforce vice laws because, excluding draconian enforcement strategies unlikely to pass a social cost-benefit test, this enforcement strategy is likely to minimize participation in vice offenses. Specifically, the Author argues that "strong" (but less than draconian) enforcement strategies-i.e., regularly applying criminal sanctions to vice offenses- are likely to generate more vice offenses than "weak" enforcement strategies-i.e., infrequently applying criminal sanctions combined with public education campaigns. This result, which runs counter to the standard economic prediction that increasing the cost of an activity reduces its incidence, is likely to occur because regularly attaching a formal "price" to a vice offense reduces marginal offenders' expected informal penalties for relaxing a principled commitment to the underlying moral norm. If strong enforcement cannot compensate for the lost deterrent effect of these extralegal penalties, then it may perversely increase the offense rate. At the same time, symbolically maintaining (but usually neglecting to enforce) criminal penalties for a vice activity, coupled with intensive public education, reinforces marginal offenders' intrinsic commitment to the relevant moral norm, thereby lowering the offense rate as desired. Given the foregoing, governments that wish to minimize participation in a particular vice activity (without violating the cost-benefit test) will rationally select weak enforcement over the alternative strategies of draconian enforcement, strong enforcement, and zero enforcement. This argument relies in part on established findings in the social psychological literature and more recent findings in the experimental economics literature. It also is weighed against, and finds support in, empirical evidence concerning historical and contemporary enforcement policies and results in several major vice industries.},

The intricacies of gay identity have been articulated largely by forces outside of the gay movement, with the inevitable result that GSOs and ASOs have occupied less space in the consciousness of gay men. Additionally, I hypothesize that men who are HIV-positive are engaging in fewer sexual contacts than men who are HIV-negative, and consequently lessening their attendance at venues where cruising is the main event.

However, their ideological bases appear to be sufficiently different to preclude such affiliations. These disparate ideologies are amplified by the mass media, and are consequently internalized by the members of the gay community.

Some writers suggest that the gay movement is going through a phase in an inevitable process of paradigm shifting, and in the end, the community will come back together-stronger and more unified than it was previously. However, if this is a phase it is clear that the gay movement is in the 'dark before the dawn' initial phase of this paradigmatic shift, and subsequent phases are by no means guaranteed. As AIDS spreads beyond marginalized groups, and infiltrates the social majority, it is possible that much of the discrimination that has positioned gay men as 'other' will be abandoned in favour of a more enlightened, pluralistic conviction of the humanity of gays as full-fledged members of a mosaic-type community structure. On the other hand, It is also possible that as AIDS spreads into mainstream Western communities, gays will be further vilified and scapegoated as the perpetrators of this deadly disease. Preventative action is required to offset this possibility-preventative action can be affected by building a strong and unified gay community ready to withstand the onslaught of the mainstream enmity. This action would frame AIDS and gayness such that this type of situation would not come about. What is required is a new mode of co-operation among ASOs and GSOs, a model which firstly puts the gay house in order, and is then suitably structured to be more inclusive of all gay men's needs, and positioned to assist in the second wave of HIV infection-the general public.},

We argue that Germany's resistance to reduce its massive current account surplus through an expansionary policy at home is rooted in distributive struggles about the design of possible adjustment policies. To explore this argument, we leverage original survey data from 135 German economic interest groups, qualitative interviews with interest group representatives and policymakers, and data from public opinion surveys. We show that while there is general support for internal adjustment among German interest groups, they disagree heavily about which specific policies should be implemented to achieve this goal. Together with a broad public and elite-based consensus to avoid a break-up of the Eurozone, this polarization turns financing into a politically attractive strategy. Rather than being rooted only in German ordoliberal ideas or Germany's export-oriented structure, distributive conflicts contribute significantly to Germany's resistance to reduce its large current-account surplus. Because similar dynamics can be observed in other surplus countries, we argue that distributive struggles within surplus countries played an important role in interstate conflicts about the management of the crisis.},

Some examples of such hazardous impregnation agents include per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. To reduce the risks related to these fluorinated substances, a phase-out is necessary, and voluntary avoidance by consumers may be one way to make this happen. This experimental survey investigates the extent to which information about the hazardous properties of fluorinated substances affects consumer willingness-to-pay for alternative outdoor garments without hazardous chemicals. The experiment was conducted by means of a questionnaire distributed to more than 4000 Swedish respondents via the Laboratory of Opinion Research's Citizen Panel. The results show a generally high willingness-to-pay, and that the effects of providing information are higher when the price increase is high. This suggests that there is room for a price increase if the non-hazardous options are more expensive. This survey experiment indicates that the Swedish general public is ready for substitution to garments without hazardous fluorinated chemicals if the alternative provides an identical function. Information campaigns, however, will have limited ability to increase the willingness-to-pay for an alternative as it is already high. Despite the general willingness of the Swedish public to choose less hazardous options, legislative measures may potentially be the most effective action when supply chains are opaque and information to consumers is limited.

	abstract = {While previous research documents a negative relationship between government size and economic growth, suggesting an economic cost of big government, a given government size generally affects growth differently in different countries. As a possible explanation of this differential effect, we explore whether government legitimacy (measured by satisfaction with the way democracy works) influences how a certain government size affects growth. On the positive side, a government perceived as legitimate may "get away" with being big since legitimacy can affect behavioral response to, and therefore the economic growth cost of, taxation and government expenditures. On the negative side, perceived legitimacy may make voters less prone to acquire information, which in turn facilitates interest-group oriented or populist policies that harm growth. A panel-data analysis of up to 30 developed countries, in which two different measures of the size of government are interacted with government legitimacy, reveals that perceived legitimacy exacerbates a negative growth effect of government size in the long run. This could be interpreted as governments taking advantage of being regarded as legitimate in order to secure short-term support at a long-term cost to the economy.},

	abstract = {While previous research documents a negative relationship between government size and economic growth, suggesting an economic cost of big government, a given government size generally affects growth differently in different countries. As a possible explanation of this differential effect, we explore whether government legitimacy (measured by satisfaction with the way democracy works) influences how a certain government size affects growth. On the positive side, a government perceived as legitimate may "get away" with being big since legitimacy can affect behavioral response to, and therefore the economic growth cost of, taxation and government expenditures. On the negative side, perceived legitimacy may make voters less prone to acquire information, which in turn facilitates interest-group oriented or populist policies that harm growth. A panel-data analysis of up to 30 developed countries, in which two different measures of the size of government are interacted with government legitimacy, reveals that perceived legitimacy exacerbates a negative growth effect of government size in the long run. This could be interpreted as governments taking advantage of being regarded as legitimate in order to secure short-term support at a long-term cost to the economy.},

To address these questions, we combine comprehensive datasets of racially conservative organizations and state immigrant legislation and use negative binomial regression to estimate the count of anti-immigrant bills and laws in the fifty states from 1991 to 2010. We find that the presence of racially conservative organizations encourages the introduction of exclusionary proposals, but only in contexts with a Republican-dominated government. At the approval stage, on the other hand, racially conservative organizations foster the passage of exclusionary laws, and this effect is heightened in contexts with a growing foreign-born population or where a majority of voters report anti-immigrant opinions or identify as conservative. This indicates that the institutionalization of the colorblind racial ideology (in the form of racially conservative organizations) resonates with lawmakers, but in a different manner when the stakes are higher.

However, an approach that considers people's perceptions on these conditions is still absent in the social psychological literature. Subjective Political Openness (SPO) is a new construct which fills this gap by incorporating features of political context into the psychological analysis of protests. We propose that SPO comprises perceptions relating to three dimensions: government actions to allow/restrict protests, police measures to actively prevent them, and the extent that public opinion legitimizes protests. We conducted two studies in the UK and Chile to validate scales created for each proposed dimension, test their measurement invariance, establish SPO's configuration, and demonstrate its convergent validity. Participants in Study 1 were university students (n UK = 203; n Chile = 237), whereas in Study 2 a general population sample from both countries was included (n UK = 377; n Chile = 309) with the purpose of generalizing the results. Both studies consistently showed that SPO is a multidimensional construct configured as a bifactor model comprising the dimensions associated with perceptions of the government and police actions to confront protests. Although we tested two different measurement scales for the perceived legitimacy given by public opinion to protests, results demonstrated this dimension is not part of SPO. The SPO configuration has implications for both our understanding of collective action and how we study it.},

However, an approach that considers people's perceptions on these conditions is still absent in the social psychological literature. Subjective Political Openness (SPO) is a new construct which fills this gap by incorporating features of political context into the psychological analysis of protests. We propose that SPO comprises perceptions relating to three dimensions: government actions to allow/restrict protests, police measures to actively prevent them, and the extent that public opinion legitimizes protests. We conducted two studies in the UK and Chile to validate scales created for each proposed dimension, test their measurement invariance, establish SPO's configuration, and demonstrate its convergent validity. Participants in Study 1 were university students (n UK = 203; n Chile = 237), whereas in Study 2 a general population sample from both countries was included (n UK = 377; n Chile = 309) with the purpose of generalizing the results. Both studies consistently showed that SPO is a multidimensional construct configured as a bifactor model comprising the dimensions associated with perceptions of the government and police actions to confront protests. Although we tested two different measurement scales for the perceived legitimacy given by public opinion to protests, results demonstrated this dimension is not part of SPO. The SPO configuration has implications for both our understanding of collective action and how we study it.},

Yet, rifts and atmospheric disruptions can be a sufficient cause for which people leave an organization. In particular, those members who seek policy change are quick to desert a group once it is shattered by internal disharmony.},

Why do some demonstrations pack long avenues with masses of people while other ones barely fill a street corner? Combining resource mobilization, political opportunity, and framing theories, we argue that mobilization strategies - the sequence of decisions and actions taken by protest organizers before staging a protest - shape demonstration size. Multivariate models with 937 Chilean demonstrations between 2000 and 2012 show that demonstrations are larger when they display more demands (especially universalistic demands), target the national government, attract more organizations (especially umbrella organizations), and mobilize cohesive groups with broad public support.

	abstract = {Massive demonstrations are the staple of powerful social movements, but research on the factors affecting the size of demonstrations (in terms of number of attendants) is almost nonexistent. Why do some demonstrations pack long avenues with masses of people while other ones barely fill a street corner? Combining resource mobilization, political opportunity, and framing theories, we argue that mobilization strategies - the sequence of decisions and actions taken by protest organizers before staging a protest - shape demonstration size. Multivariate models with 937 Chilean demonstrations between 2000 and 2012 show that demonstrations are larger when they display more demands (especially universalistic demands), target the national government, attract more organizations (especially umbrella organizations), and mobilize cohesive groups with broad public support. We reinforce the internal validity of our argument using interviews with movement leaders and secondary research on Chilean society.},

We also identify the effect of interaction variables across levels.

Empirical assessments of these efforts have reported mixed results. Animal advocacy groups also use litigation as a means of improving the treatment of nonhuman animals, but there has been limited empirical testing of the effectiveness of animal advocacy, litigation. To fill this gap in the literature, this study examines the 188 animal law cases decided in state supreme courts from 1973 through 2005. It looks specifically, at whether the participation of an animal advocacy, organization increases the chance of a favorable decision, while controlling for legal and political influences on case outcomes. Logistic regression reveals that the presence of animal advocacy groups does not exert a statistically, significant impact oil case outcomes. Further analysis demonstrates, however, that animal advocacy groups are significantly, more likely than nongroup litigators to pursue cases that are difficult to win.},

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, animal advocacy groups have attempted to improve the treatment of nonhuman animals by influencing public opinion and lobbying for legislation that protects animals. Empirical assessments of these efforts have reported mixed results. Animal advocacy groups also use litigation as a means of improving the treatment of nonhuman animals, but there has been limited empirical testing of the effectiveness of animal advocacy, litigation. To fill this gap in the literature, this study examines the 188 animal law cases decided in state supreme courts from 1973 through 2005. It looks specifically, at whether the participation of an animal advocacy, organization increases the chance of a favorable decision, while controlling for legal and political influences on case outcomes. Logistic regression reveals that the presence of animal advocacy groups does not exert a statistically, significant impact oil case outcomes. Further analysis demonstrates, however, that animal advocacy groups are significantly, more likely than nongroup litigators to pursue cases that are difficult to win.},

	abstract = {The sociology of collective action has addressed one-sided, nongovernmental anti-minority violence rather infrequently. To explain the preconditions for violence, the "power approach of intergroup hostility" is drawn upon, which entails two processes: the red or imagined threat by an out-group and the identification with an in-group. The conflict dynamic arises out of a change in the balance of power between groups (immigration, economic success, equal rights, symbolic threats). This change has to be translated into a threatening scenario by (mass) communication in which norms change and the target group is gradually delegitimized and "excommunicated" so that violence tends to be regarded as a means of "social control" and as self-help by a group. The "power approach" has to be supplemented with the concept of "frame analysis" and with the theory of social control developed by Donald Black in order to explain the use of pogrom-like violence. Pogroms are defined as entailing three partners: a group of the majority, a targeted minority, and the state. The aggressor regards himself as the legitimate representative of the majority. Pogroms require a specific "opportunity structure" in order to develop in which the behavior of the government, police, public opinion and the bystanders fulfil a key function in the escalation of violence. The excessive violence of pogroms does nor fit easily into the categories of purposeful or symbolic action.

We argue that policy feedback effects on public opinion were the most important factor inhibiting changes to Malaysia's health financing system. Interest group opposition was a closely related factor; this opposition was particularly powerful because political leaders perceived that it had strong public support. Institutional veto gates, by contrast, played a minimal role in preventing health financing reform in Malaysia. Malaysia's dramatic early success at achieving near-universal access to public sector healthcare at low cost created public opinion resistant to any change which could threaten the status quo.

The Video Volunteers and CGNET Swara are two citizen journalism organizations that work in Central India, in areas whose human and development indexes are among the lowest in the country. Citizen journalism has been studied both as a consequence and as an instigator of social revolution. The Arab Spring movement and the case of Mohamed Bouazizi in the 2010 Tunisian uprisings are prominent recent examples. But citizen journalism in these and similar cases usually focus on the framing of martyr narratives where individuals and their protests or reactions against human rights atrocities make them "a symbol of the struggle for justice, dignity and freedom." Through a content analysis of 400 news stories posted in the year 2015-2016 and qualitative interviews with 30 participants and a focus group of 15 participants, this study analyses how the Video Volunteers and CGNET Swara train citizens to produce news, the kinds of frame that are used to mobilize audiences, and encourage them to articulate outrage against the many human rights atrocities that occur in these areas. Findings show that citizen journalism succeeds because of the culturally resonant frames used and effective frame alignment that resonate with their main audiences and producers. The news produced and disseminated activates connective structures to facilitate collective action among audiences and communities who earlier had little means or recourse to address such issues. This collective action encourages participants to gather offline to fight for their demands and positively transform their communities.},

Through a content analysis of 400 news stories posted in the year 2015-2016 and qualitative interviews with 30 participants and a focus group of 15 participants, this study analyses how the Video Volunteers and CGNET Swara train citizens to produce news, the kinds of frame that are used to mobilize audiences, and encourage them to articulate outrage against the many human rights atrocities that occur in these areas. Findings show that citizen journalism succeeds because of the culturally resonant frames used and effective frame alignment that resonate with their main audiences and producers. The news produced and disseminated activates connective structures to facilitate collective action among audiences and communities who earlier had little means or recourse to address such issues. This collective action encourages participants to gather offline to fight for their demands and positively transform their communities.},

The author tries to give an overview of the development in standpoints of the Estonian national leaders in the realm of rule and direction of the folk (in the first place peasant) school, tracing the relation between the negative and constructive side of this matter. From the 1830s the Estonian peasant school had been administrated by the Consistories of the Lutheran Church and the Baltic Knightages with the help of their provincial school institutions. The struggle to provide the Estonian communities and educated persons with access to supervision of the folk school began from the beginning of the Estonian national movement (in the 1860s). We can see the development from indistinct, unrealistic proposals and na ve hope on benevolence of the Russian government (tsar) to more self-confidence and significant demands. The memorandum of Estonian village communities (1864) declared that the Estonian peasant schools should be administrated by the Ministry of Education of the Russian Empire. Actually this request stood for the elimination of the unequal and estate provincial school administration. However, no constructive proposal had been added. In the next essential memorandum to the Russian government in 1881, which reflected the views of the radical and somewhat Russophile wing of the national movement led by Carl Robert Jakobson, a newspaper editor, the central political proposal was for the reform of the provincial self-government with an equal representation for the Estonians with the Baltic Germans and the unification of the areas populated by Estonians into one administrative unit (national province). As to peasant education, the Estonian leaders demanded there only the abolition of the Baltic German control and inspection, the Ministry of Education was not even mentioned. This memorandum reflects hesitation with regard to Russian educational institutions. Hypothetically we can suppose that the radical national leaders had connected the problems of school administration with the prospective Estonian national self-government. The Russificatory reforms in the 1880s and the introduction of Russian as the language of instruction in all types of schools were a serious disappointment to the Estonian public opinion. Estonians did not receive the slightest opportunity to participate in school administration. The Revolution of 1905 stimulated the rise of political activity and pluralism. The Estonian liberal and socialist parties and movements disclosed their programmes, which included democratic, at times ultra-democratic requirements also in the sphere of school administration. The author attempts to discuss the problems from the point of view of the level of maturity of Estonian society for the national territorial and administrative autonomy within the Russian Empire and draws a conclusion that although speaking about autonomy and independence in the sphere of education the Estonian leaders nevertheless frequently laid too much hope on the financial support from the Russian government and gave up too much of authority to the state administration. In 1911 Peeter P o ld, who was to become the first Minister of Education for the Republic of Estonia (1918) and the first professor of education at Tartu University (1920 -1930), published the first comprehensive project of subordination, guidance and control of local schools in Estonia, in which he attached great importance to the lower levels of guidance and control (village communities and parishes).

	abstract = {Perlo's engagement with the complex and ambiguous relationship between Marxism (and, more broadly, the socialist traditions) and the moral status of animals is very much to be welcomed. This sort of engagement is valuable for three main reasons. First, the more narrowly focused social movement activity-whether committed to animal rights, social justice in the workplace, or advancement for women-is liable to cut itself off from critical insights created in the context of other movements. I became aware of this, particularly during the 1980s in relation to radical green politics, as both deepening and widening the already existing socialist case against neo-liberal capitalism, just as the women's liberation movement had done a decade or more earlier Second, this sort of analysis is valuable because without it "single-issue" movements run a serious risk of advancing the claims of their own preferred social group at the cost of (usually unknowingly and unintentionally) deepening the oppression or exploitation of other groups. Third, where radical social movements campaign for changes that conflict with the interests of wealthy and powerful interests, and are committed to democratic values, they need to be able to bring public opinion with them. Single-issue movements rarely can do this on their own: Broad-based coalitions are needed. Moreover, the sources of radical thought and the range of justified grievances are now so diverse that the notion of a single, unified political party as the centralized vehicle of change is no longer viable (if it ever was). So, the broadly based coalition has to be diverse and difference-respecting. But can it be this while still maintaining enough unity of purpose and coordination of its actions to be effective?},

	abstract = {Perlo's engagement with the complex and ambiguous relationship between Marxism (and, more broadly, the socialist traditions) and the moral status of animals is very much to be welcomed. This sort of engagement is valuable for three main reasons. First, the more narrowly focused social movement activity-whether committed to animal rights, social justice in the workplace, or advancement for women-is liable to cut itself off from critical insights created in the context of other movements. I became aware of this, particularly during the 1980s in relation to radical green politics, as both deepening and widening the already existing socialist case against neo-liberal capitalism, just as the women's liberation movement had done a decade or more earlier Second, this sort of analysis is valuable because without it "single-issue" movements run a serious risk of advancing the claims of their own preferred social group at the cost of (usually unknowingly and unintentionally) deepening the oppression or exploitation of other groups. Third, where radical social movements campaign for changes that conflict with the interests of wealthy and powerful interests, and are committed to democratic values, they need to be able to bring public opinion with them. Single-issue movements rarely can do this on their own: Broad-based coalitions are needed. Moreover, the sources of radical thought and the range of justified grievances are now so diverse that the notion of a single, unified political party as the centralized vehicle of change is no longer viable (if it ever was). So, the broadly based coalition has to be diverse and difference-respecting. But can it be this while still maintaining enough unity of purpose and coordination of its actions to be effective?},

Method: We merged incident-level data from 1,881,802 violent incidents in the National Incident-Based Reporting System for 2015-2016 with contextual data from the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for 1,679 counties within 38 states. We conducted multilevel models examining the relationship between co-offending group size, the presence of a firearm. regional context, and serious injury among assault offenses. Results: Findings reveal that firearms are more likely to be present as the number of offenders increases and more likely to be present in the Confederate South than in other regions. Further, the risk of serious injury increases as group size increases and is greater when a firearm is present. Finally, and most importantly, regional context moderates the influence of co-offending group size and the presence of a firearm on serious injury. Specifically, incidents committed by larger groups, with firearms, in the Confederate South result in particularly high rates of serious injury.

This study offers a new analytical model for studying activism by independently and simultaneously examining the direct and indirect effects of perceptions of majority support, individual support and media use on political behaviour. The experimental results suggest that perceptions of public opinion and media use did affect participation in the 2011 social movement. Specifically, increased perception of majority support for the movement led to increased rates of participation. Moreover, media use was inconsequential among those respondents who perceived that a majority of the public supported the protest. Digital media had a moderate effect on the association between perceptions and support for the protest movement, but there was no such effect with respect to mainstream media use. The findings provide new empirical insight into the effects of perceptions of public opinion and media use on political behaviour.

The findings provide new empirical insight into the effects of perceptions of public opinion and media use on political behaviour. In doing so, they help to explain the development of mass protest movements in the digital age and especially the potential effect of perceptions and media use in promoting the evolution of social movements as well as involvement in collective action in the digital age.},

	abstract = {China has witnessed unprecedented and rapid urbanization which has led to the depopulation and structural collapse of many traditional rural village communities, and the decline of many collective functions such as the effective management of the public realm. In seeking to address this problem it is clear from the literature that there is considerable potential in catalyzing collective action, particularly where there is a moral imperative to act and the availability of leaders with the ability to organize the collective. However, while there is evidence that community-based collective action has provided effective localized solution pathways for managing collective goods when the focus has been on the distribution of benefits, there is little evidence about its potential in scenarios associated with the distribution of costs, or responsibilities. In addressing this asymmetry, we present a case study of a typical village near Shanghai which has successfully established a community based environmental management system, and describe the process, characteristics and influencing factors of its responsibility-centered collective action. Our findings show that smart local leadership, an effective organizing strategy, and involvement of a suitable 'core group' was crucial. The strategy of mobilizing this core group, of empowering them with decision-making rights, and supporting their volunteered role as a 'bridge and platform' connecting the village cadres and villagers, significantly reduced the enforcement and monitoring costs, controlled free rider problems, and gained public support and participation, leading to a stable and sustainable solution. Our findings illustrate specific principles that apply to many cases in China, and general principles that are likely to be applicable more widely.},

The SEPA bureaucrats have the highest marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to improve environmental quality. Differences in MWTP are robust and not due to differences in socio-economic characteristics across the populations. We only found weak evidence of multiple preference orderings.},

We study preferences for environmental policy using a choice experiment (CE) on three populations; the general public, Swedish EPA bureaucrats, and recreational anglers. We also test for existence of multiple preference orderings: Half of the respondents were asked to choose the alternatives that best corresponded with their opinion, and the other half was asked to take the role of a policy-maker and make recommendations for environmental policy. The SEPA bureaucrats have the highest marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) to improve environmental quality. Differences in MWTP are robust and not due to differences in socio-economic characteristics across the populations. We only found weak evidence of multiple preference orderings.},

We analyzed 153 in-depth interviews with workers and organizers conducted at the height of the debate, in order to answer two questions: What is the role of outsider organizers during private sector union recognition campaigns, and how do outsider organizers secure workers' consent in these settings? All of the organizers in our data-set were graduates of the AFL-CIO's Organizing Institute, and 64 of them were outsiders. The outsider organizers in our data-set confronted barriers that insider organizers did not, including workers' concerns about their youth, inexperience and lack of professionalism, and their own inability to relate to workers.

The vast majority of outsider organizers in our data-set successfully secured workers' consent by demonstrating commitment, building relationships, and being honest and forthright.

A central actor in the democratic struggle, the movement continues to play a crucial role in the post-apartheid period. However, public opinion data collected by the South African Social Attitudes Survey for the period 2011-2013 suggest that only a minority of the public currently trust the organized labour movement. No cleavage in individual trust in trade unions was noted between age cohorts and labour market status. Distrust among the lower and working class has expanded significantly between 2011 and 2013. Findings suggest that trade unions in the country are increasingly associated with the unpopular political establishment. More research on public attitudes towards unions is required. There is a need for trade unions to intensify their engagement with working-class communities in order to build greater levels of individual trust.},

	abstract = {The South African organized labour movement is one of the most powerful on the African continent. A central actor in the democratic struggle, the movement continues to play a crucial role in the post-apartheid period. However, public opinion data collected by the South African Social Attitudes Survey for the period 2011-2013 suggest that only a minority of the public currently trust the organized labour movement. No cleavage in individual trust in trade unions was noted between age cohorts and labour market status. Distrust among the lower and working class has expanded significantly between 2011 and 2013. Findings suggest that trade unions in the country are increasingly associated with the unpopular political establishment. More research on public attitudes towards unions is required. There is a need for trade unions to intensify their engagement with working-class communities in order to build greater levels of individual trust.},

	abstract = {Traditional work on bystander intervention in violent emergencies has found that the larger the group, the less the chance that any individual will intervene. Here, we tested the impact on helping behavior of the affiliation of the bystanders with respect to the participants. We recruited 40 male supporters of the U.K. Arsenal football club for a two-factor between groups study with 10 participants per group. Each participant spoke with a virtual human Arsenal supporter (V), the scenario displayed in a virtual reality system. During this conversation, another virtual character (P), not an Arsenal fan, verbally abused V for being an Arsenal fan leading eventually to physical pushing. There was a group of three virtual bystanders who were all either Arsenal supporters indicated by their shirts, or football fans wearing unbranded shirts. These bystanders either encouraged the participant to intervene or dissuaded him. We recorded the number of times that participants intervened to help V during the aggression. We found that participants were more likely to intervene when the bystanders were out-group with respect to the participant. By comparing levels of intervention with a "baseline" study (identical except for the presence of bystanders), we conclude that the presence of in-group bystanders decreases helping. We argue therefore that, other things being equal, diffusion of responsibility is more likely to be overcome when participant and victim share group membership, but bystanders do not. Our findings help to develop understanding of how diffusion of responsibility works by combining elements of both the bystander effect and the social identity approach to bystander behavior.},

	abstract = {Traditional work on bystander intervention in violent emergencies has found that the larger the group, the less the chance that any individual will intervene. Here, we tested the impact on helping behavior of the affiliation of the bystanders with respect to the participants. We recruited 40 male supporters of the U.K. Arsenal football club for a two-factor between groups study with 10 participants per group. Each participant spoke with a virtual human Arsenal supporter (V), the scenario displayed in a virtual reality system. During this conversation, another virtual character (P), not an Arsenal fan, verbally abused V for being an Arsenal fan leading eventually to physical pushing. There was a group of three virtual bystanders who were all either Arsenal supporters indicated by their shirts, or football fans wearing unbranded shirts. These bystanders either encouraged the participant to intervene or dissuaded him. We recorded the number of times that participants intervened to help V during the aggression. We found that participants were more likely to intervene when the bystanders were out-group with respect to the participant. By comparing levels of intervention with a "baseline" study (identical except for the presence of bystanders), we conclude that the presence of in-group bystanders decreases helping. We argue therefore that, other things being equal, diffusion of responsibility is more likely to be overcome when participant and victim share group membership, but bystanders do not. Our findings help to develop understanding of how diffusion of responsibility works by combining elements of both the bystander effect and the social identity approach to bystander behavior.},

The literature on the Gulf and Kuwait in particular focus on payoffs as a way of explaining acquiesance, yet payoffs in 2011 and 2012 had almost no impact on protest mobilisation. Instead, it may be more normative issues that kept protesters away: the unrealistic and aggressive demands of protest organisers for regime change. This article focuses on the legitimacy, or lackthereof, of the government and regime to explain the failure of the "Arab Spring" protest movement in Kuwait, looking at how consent and normative concerns impacted the decision of protesters to leave the streets. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with citizens who participated in the protests, interviews with dozens of members of the opposition leadership, and group surveys at 13 tribal diwaniyas that highlight a cross-section of protesters' opinion. The research presented demonstrates that public support for the social movement may have in part failed largely because the movement was unsuccessful in framing that it could govern if it was successful. Public support was also limited by protest tactics including disrupting modes of transportation and livelihood. At the heart of protesters' concerns was the lack of a substantive opposition they could believe in and poor opinions on the quality of leadership in Karamat Watan.

One important question relates to the access that these national groups gain to European policymakers. Building on this literature, we innovatively explore differences in access to European policymakers between national groups that are members of EU umbrella associations and organizations that are not members of EU umbrellas. To study this, we rely on survey data of more than 1600 national interest groups active in the EU. The results indicate that organizations which are members of umbrella organizations gain more access to European policymakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that financial resources and professionalization, common determinants of access, only have an effect on access for organizations that are members of umbrella associations.

	abstract = {Over the past decade, we have seen a sharp increase in studies focusing on the activities of national interest groups in the European Union. One important question relates to the access that these national groups gain to European policymakers. Building on this literature, we innovatively explore differences in access to European policymakers between national groups that are members of EU umbrella associations and organizations that are not members of EU umbrellas. To study this, we rely on survey data of more than 1600 national interest groups active in the EU. The results indicate that organizations which are members of umbrella organizations gain more access to European policymakers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that financial resources and professionalization, common determinants of access, only have an effect on access for organizations that are members of umbrella associations. These findings highlight the importance of umbrella organizations for EU lobbying.},

Our study also explores various organizational incentives advocacy groups use to maintain support.

Our findings suggest that many local advocacy groups did receive enhanced public support in the forms of volunteer requests, donations, and membership immediately after the election and the majority of them were able to retain the support over time.

We also find that race consciousness affects respondents' attitudes toward affirmative action, but that this effect is moderated by political ideology.},

What enabled responses to COVID-19 to be as effective as they were, right at a time when climate action is notably lagging behind what intergovernmental panels have called for? This paper examines key differences in the COVID-19 response compared to that of climate change, examining the 'deeper' human dimensions of these global issues. Unearthing insights into the responses to both issues provides important lessons for climate change engagement. Technical summary In the first half of 2020, a dramatic, fast and widespread series of changes occurred in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in behaviors, mindsets, culture, and systems. Yet, despite the intergovernmental calls for precisely this kind of fundamental, transformative change across society regarding global warming, public opinion on climate change is fractured and collective action is slow. More research is needed on the psychosocial dimensions of climate change, to better understand what the bottlenecks are for realizing transformative change. In this paper, I examine what occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic response that could be learned for the climate crisis. I focus on three psychological aspects that made the COVID-19 response accessible and actionable in a way that climate change is not: the mental demands for understanding complex issues; psychological distance and its impacts on motivation and agency; and finite attentional resources that can render certain issues as non-salient. Lessons for climate engagement include: (1) the usefulness of concrete, simple, and personally-relatable messaging; (2) more diverse and democratized climate understandings and stories; (3) greater recognition about how psychological distance affects meaning-making and sense of agency; and (4) appreciation of attentional crowding and the need for sense-making strategies about complex issues.

	doi = {10.18564/jasss.2872},
	abstract = {This paper examines the intervention strategies for the diffusion of collective behavior, such as promoting innovation adoption and repressing a strike. An intervention strategy refers to controlling the behaviors of a small number of individuals in terms of their social or personal attributes, including connectivity (i.e., the number of social ties one holds), motivation (i.e., an individual's intrinsic cost-benefit judgment on behavior change), and sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which one follows others).

An intervention strategy refers to controlling the behaviors of a small number of individuals in terms of their social or personal attributes, including connectivity (i.e., the number of social ties one holds), motivation (i.e., an individual's intrinsic cost-benefit judgment on behavior change), and sensitivity (i.e., the degree to which one follows others).

	volume = {26},
	issn = {0049-1225},
	abstract = {Observing the processes of political and economic transformation after 1989 it turns out that youth and representatives of the youth's movements are annually more and more pushed out from the social happenings, their subject position marginalizes. Youth is seen by the eyes of public as a problematic and dangerous social group subjected to all traps of the open society. The representatives lose the partnership towards the state step by step, even in the case of keeping and increasing the property of the former youth organization instead of bringing benefits for children and youth of the Slovak Republic. In our opinion, the marginalization problem lays in our totalitarian, brown and red traditions. The system of work with young people, according to one party's aims, reached the high level of ideological unification and political action of youth. This became a tradition influencing the experience and minds of many generations. As a part of this, the young generation was pictured in the public opinion and youth's self-reflection as a historically important subject with a social mission. From this point of view, the contemporaneous problem is not the youth's ”marginalization”, but rather our traditionalism. The modernization is the process of social changes. Sometimes it affects very painfully our traditional waiting for a collectivistic revolutionary behavior of the young generation's movement. The problem of stated social appeal is expected to be sorted out as in the past (e.g. collectivization, urbanization and industrialization, etc.). A substance of the systematic change causes the modern waiting. It tends to combine a modern prosperity of the society with perfect and enormous individual's efforts at the competitive labor market. Youth changes from the homogenous social group (as it was stated in the socialistic social structure) to social-age aggregate of individuals in the certain period of a life circle. A significant change of the original youth's identity is connected with the highest authorities inability to understand this change in the Postsocialistic countries. As well as to accept the fact that the state secure at least appropriate and timely legislative, support financially an elementary infrastructure of the work with youth based on civil youth associations, and secure the stability of the process of socialization. (Merkel, A., 1994). The challenge of the modernization growing from the transformation processes is not delimited only to the young generation. Also other age groups feel to be spoken to. Consequently, this also marginalizes the young generation. This challenge is the challenge for an individual and determined as an individualization. Ken Roberts (1994) states it as a personal disposition or young adolescents ability to take on a responsibility for their decisions as well as admit the risks and social impacts thereof. According to Ivan Velev (1994) individualization is the presumption for the modernization, German sociologists extrapolate it also at the reconstruction of the former totalitarian society in the GDR. For these reasons we consider the transformation of organized youth's movements, changes in position of the civil youth associations, representatives conduct towards the state and youth itself to be a very remarkable sociological phenomenon with its theoretical and pragmatic implications for the processes of modernization. As for active social actors, in accordance to Alain Touraine, it is incontestable that the individuals - actors who seek to achieve personal goals in an environment made up of other agents”...and constituting a community to which they feel they belong and whose culture and rules of institutional functioning they share, at least in part”. (Touraine, A. 1993, p. 425). To produce the active social actors, the existence of certain personal aims is not sufficient. Also an ability to communicate and manifest an engaged citizenship is needed. The representatives of the youth associations were able to unify themselves and manifest their engagement to secure financial and organizational programs of leisure time activities for children and youth from the budget. They cooperated also in the effort to obtain certain possibility to participate at administrative bodies as use more effectively the youth property. The gradual process of the political system transformation is reflected visibly above all in the pluralization of the youth's movement. There is disability and strong disinterest from the representatives to articulate specific interests and needs of the young people in the field of education, professional preparation, social and housing policies. The participation at the social modernization impacts is expected only from the left youth's organizations or special humanity and charity organizations. Interests and needs of youth are more and more distant from the representatives who lose the ability to reflect new processes into meaningful program so that public and youth will accept them as real problems. Generally we can state that during the past period no demands presented by the Slovak Council of Youth (SCY) in the public as youth's interests and needs were supported by civil participation of youth (i.e., petition, recessive demonstration). Furthermore, we do not know the case of SCY applying for the support of those whose interests it represents. This is the specific situation distinguished by A. Touraine in Chile. The admitted representatives of youth into the state administrative bodies and developed communication between state and associations representatives can not supple the sense of the citizenship. According to an author, it is very remarkable that”...while there is such a massive demand everywhere for political participation and dialogue, there is still little capacity for collective action and the ideological formulation of such demands”. (Touraine, A., 1993, p. 426). Moreover, the main aim of the social actors is according to A. Touraine to encourage ”the spirit of the citizenship” in the frame of the youth policy. According to Dieter Rucht (Rucht, D., 1994) it is not enough to create problems of a certain arrangement by the deprivation of individuals and/or by artificial conviction of something wrong with them. The change can be reached by the different institutional arrangement of interests' satisfaction or innovation of the laws. This assumes scandalize opponents occasionally, create intellectual conceptions and strategic programs inspiring the expectations of success, help to make specific conditions also for the mobilization and time stability of the civil movement. The Council of Youth is a collective actor. If support absents, young citizens are not protected from the increasing marginalization or social isolation resulted from subordinated education and youth policies to the market economy or ideology. This explains why do the subjects of the European Council give an attention to the problem of associative youth life. Beside this, the research-analytical effort and methodologies to understand the development of the youth's movement in the Middle European countries seem to be sometimes a type of sociological intervention. They focus to cause expected modernization changes. Experts of the European Council (Stafseng, O., 1994) evaluated positively the certain period of the transformation process according to associative life of youth with the dominant status of plurality in the political system. The challenge for the modernization of Slovakia and to join the structure of Europe is also the challenge for the Slovak Council of Youth to be a collective actor, admit its mission, encourage the ”citizenship” feeling of the young people, and create conditions for articulation and solution of their problems and needs.},

	abstract = {Observing the processes of political and economic transformation after 1989 it turns out that youth and representatives of the youth's movements are annually more and more pushed out from the social happenings, their subject position marginalizes. Youth is seen by the eyes of public as a problematic and dangerous social group subjected to all traps of the open society. The representatives lose the partnership towards the state step by step, even in the case of keeping and increasing the property of the former youth organization instead of bringing benefits for children and youth of the Slovak Republic. In our opinion, the marginalization problem lays in our totalitarian, brown and red traditions. The system of work with young people, according to one party's aims, reached the high level of ideological unification and political action of youth. This became a tradition influencing the experience and minds of many generations. As a part of this, the young generation was pictured in the public opinion and youth's self-reflection as a historically important subject with a social mission. From this point of view, the contemporaneous problem is not the youth's ”marginalization”, but rather our traditionalism. The modernization is the process of social changes. Sometimes it affects very painfully our traditional waiting for a collectivistic revolutionary behavior of the young generation's movement. The problem of stated social appeal is expected to be sorted out as in the past (e.g. collectivization, urbanization and industrialization, etc.). A substance of the systematic change causes the modern waiting. It tends to combine a modern prosperity of the society with perfect and enormous individual's efforts at the competitive labor market. Youth changes from the homogenous social group (as it was stated in the socialistic social structure) to social-age aggregate of individuals in the certain period of a life circle. A significant change of the original youth's identity is connected with the highest authorities inability to understand this change in the Postsocialistic countries. As well as to accept the fact that the state secure at least appropriate and timely legislative, support financially an elementary infrastructure of the work with youth based on civil youth associations, and secure the stability of the process of socialization. (Merkel, A., 1994). The challenge of the modernization growing from the transformation processes is not delimited only to the young generation. Also other age groups feel to be spoken to. Consequently, this also marginalizes the young generation. This challenge is the challenge for an individual and determined as an individualization. Ken Roberts (1994) states it as a personal disposition or young adolescents ability to take on a responsibility for their decisions as well as admit the risks and social impacts thereof. According to Ivan Velev (1994) individualization is the presumption for the modernization, German sociologists extrapolate it also at the reconstruction of the former totalitarian society in the GDR. For these reasons we consider the transformation of organized youth's movements, changes in position of the civil youth associations, representatives conduct towards the state and youth itself to be a very remarkable sociological phenomenon with its theoretical and pragmatic implications for the processes of modernization. As for active social actors, in accordance to Alain Touraine, it is incontestable that the individuals - actors who seek to achieve personal goals in an environment made up of other agents”...and constituting a community to which they feel they belong and whose culture and rules of institutional functioning they share, at least in part”. (Touraine, A. 1993, p. 425). To produce the active social actors, the existence of certain personal aims is not sufficient. Also an ability to communicate and manifest an engaged citizenship is needed. The representatives of the youth associations were able to unify themselves and manifest their engagement to secure financial and organizational programs of leisure time activities for children and youth from the budget. They cooperated also in the effort to obtain certain possibility to participate at administrative bodies as use more effectively the youth property. The gradual process of the political system transformation is reflected visibly above all in the pluralization of the youth's movement. There is disability and strong disinterest from the representatives to articulate specific interests and needs of the young people in the field of education, professional preparation, social and housing policies. The participation at the social modernization impacts is expected only from the left youth's organizations or special humanity and charity organizations. Interests and needs of youth are more and more distant from the representatives who lose the ability to reflect new processes into meaningful program so that public and youth will accept them as real problems. Generally we can state that during the past period no demands presented by the Slovak Council of Youth (SCY) in the public as youth's interests and needs were supported by civil participation of youth (i.e., petition, recessive demonstration). Furthermore, we do not know the case of SCY applying for the support of those whose interests it represents. This is the specific situation distinguished by A. Touraine in Chile. The admitted representatives of youth into the state administrative bodies and developed communication between state and associations representatives can not supple the sense of the citizenship. According to an author, it is very remarkable that”...while there is such a massive demand everywhere for political participation and dialogue, there is still little capacity for collective action and the ideological formulation of such demands”.

Study 2 described a fictitious organization that responded to race-related mega-threats by messaging support for either Black Lives Matter (BLM), Blue Lives Matter, All Lives Matter, or no social movement. Prospective employees perceived higher levels of POSDI when the company issued a statement in support of BLM (relative to the other movements), which in turn was associated with higher OA. Study 3 focused on current employees and examined how POSDI influences financial outcomes in real Fortune 500 companies. Organizations that issued statements publicly supporting the Black community following a race-related mega-threat received higher POSDI ratings by employees, which predicted increased organizational revenue, even after controlling for revenue prior to making the statements.

	abstract = {The commons concept has evolved in multiple ways after the publication of Ostrom's seminal work in 1990, which emphasized the evolution of resource management institutions and the usefulness of self-governance. As we move into the 21(st) century, one of the institutional transformations is catalyzed by the emergence of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a techno-economic paradigm shift and the epochal creation of a new online social structure. However, there is a lack of understanding about the impact of ICT on common resource management, particularly in urban settings, that is urban commons. This study presents a systematic literature review of ICT-enabled urban commons with particular attention to its application to climate-related issues such as climate mitigation/adaptation in order to improve our collective ability to leverage ICT for building a more sustainable and resilient city. A total of 66 pieces of literature were included in our qualitative synthesis. We analyzed the geographical, categorical, and climate relevance. Subsequently, we used the coupled infrastructure system framework as a system thinking approach to dissect distinct usefulness of ICT-enabled commons in the building of relationships between resource system, resource user, infrastructure, and infrastructure provider to tackle climate-related issues. Our findings identified three key contributions of ICT to innovate climate-resilient solutions: 1) to redefine role of resource user as co-producer, co-designer, and co-monitor; 2) to enable real-time data-driven urban planning; 3) to improve resource efficiency and effectiveness. In other words, in a time of insufficient and limited public resources, the public sector can leverage the power of technology to harness public support and engage non-traditional stakeholders to make cities more sustainable and resilient while allowing policy-making to be big data-driven to tackle new urban problems that cannot be otherwise uncovered without the aid of ICT. The results provide directions to rethink the city based on collective action to diversity modes to govern common resources.},

A total of 66 pieces of literature were included in our qualitative synthesis. We analyzed the geographical, categorical, and climate relevance. Subsequently, we used the coupled infrastructure system framework as a system thinking approach to dissect distinct usefulness of ICT-enabled commons in the building of relationships between resource system, resource user, infrastructure, and infrastructure provider to tackle climate-related issues. Our findings identified three key contributions of ICT to innovate climate-resilient solutions: 1) to redefine role of resource user as co-producer, co-designer, and co-monitor; 2) to enable real-time data-driven urban planning; 3) to improve resource efficiency and effectiveness. In other words, in a time of insufficient and limited public resources, the public sector can leverage the power of technology to harness public support and engage non-traditional stakeholders to make cities more sustainable and resilient while allowing policy-making to be big data-driven to tackle new urban problems that cannot be otherwise uncovered without the aid of ICT. The results provide directions to rethink the city based on collective action to diversity modes to govern common resources.},

This is especially true because social science research shows that lay people generally think about criminal liability and punishment in consistent ways: in terms of desert, doing justice, and avoiding injustice. Moreover, there are compelling reasons to demand consistency between community views and criminal law rules, including respect for democratic values, effective crime-control, and the deontological value of justice itself. It may then come as a surprise, and a disappointment, that a wide range of common rules in modern criminal law conflict with community justice judgments, including three strikes and other habitual offender statutes, abolition or narrowing of the insanity defense, adult prosecution of juveniles, felony murder, strict liability offenses, and a variety of other common doctrines. In short, democratically elected legislatures have regularly chosen to adopt criminal law rules that conflict with the deep and abiding intuitions of their constituents. We endeavor to explain how this incongruent situation has arisen. Using the legislative and political histories of the doctrines noted above, we document four common causes: legislative mistake about the community's justice judgments, interest group pressure, prioritizing coercive crime-control mechanisms over doing justice and legislative preference for delegating some criminalization decisions to other system actors, such as prosecutors and judges. Analysis of these reasons and their dynamics suggests specific reforms, including a legislative commitment to reliably determine community judgment before enactment and to publicly explain the reasons for enacting any criminal law rule that conflicts.

The results revealed a full mediational pathway from police action perceived as indiscriminate that facilitated the public's identification with the militant protesters and bolstered public support for the militant protest.

	abstract = {In Northwest Indiana, a new urban forestry effort called CommuniTree has emerged with a goal of helping solve some of the region's post-industrial social and ecological issues. Though no panacea, tree planting can have significant benefits, including air pollution abatement, temperature moderation, stormwater management, and beautification. CommuniTree is a Collective Impact-style collaborative of over a dozen partner groups (public, nonprofit, private, and partnership organizations) that plants trees on public and industrial properties in postindustrial Northwest Indiana communities where urban forestry governance and resources are relatively lacking. This paper presents the results of the first phase of a transdisciplinary research program that draws insights from urban forest governance scholarship and transdisciplinary sustainability science as well as from urban forest professionals involved in CommuniTree who helped design the research. We used a transdisciplinary case study approach with qualitative interviews with key informants from CommuniTree partner organizations to investigate partner organizations' motivations for participating, desired outcomes, and long-term visions for CommuniTree. We find that the CommuniTree partnership itself is an intrinsic incentive to partners' participation: once an influential champion brought the group together, they were motivated to stay involved by the work and structure of CommuniTree. The scant existing urban forest governance in the region also motivated partners to contribute to CommuniTree collective action. For desired outcomes, we find that partners are interested in the potential improvements to ecological quality that may result for the region such as improved stormwater management and air quality, but that more than ecological outcomes, partners are interested in the social outcomes that might come of the CommuniTree, including engaging communities in ecological stewardship activities and the beautification and general improvements to public spaces that result from tree planting. And for its future, partners conveyed a plurality of visions for CommuniTree's growth including expanding the program to new communities, planting trees on new types of locations, and involving more partners, the general public, and new volunteer groups. However, current CommuniTree structure has vulnerabilities to its sustainability and longevity, including a reliance on predominantly grant funding, shifting organizational dynamics within/among partners, and a lack of systematic integration of the voices of local community members. In conclusion, this research on CommuniTree's structure and function (i.e., the governance and activities) and on what partners value as desired outcomes and for the future informs an understanding of the vulnerabilities and opportunities for CommuniTree as the program evolves to better meet the needs of current partners, future stakeholders, and, most importantly, community members.},

Previous studies mapping these changes have primarily relied on empirical analyses of formal policy and political processes. This case-study of Sweden takes an alternative route, and analyses a dataset of 1405 Swedish newspaper articles (1985-2019) using a new institutional theory and social movement theory framework. Therethrough, the paper is able to provide new insights into the emergence and development of an institutional issue field concerned with the prevention of terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation. More specifically, the paper highlights the unstable, fragmented, dynamic and contested character of the field's development. Frames containing the problems and solutions considered most important during each of the field's five stages are identified, and the subsequent institutional and organisational consequences are discussed. The paper also considers how terror attacks and other extremism-related events impact the institutionalisation and alternation of dominant frames, and identifies the translation and development of an inclusive vocabulary as pivotal to mobilising a broad and diverse set of actors to co-produce preventive efforts.},

	abstract = {National approaches to prevent terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation have changed considerably over the last decades. Previous studies mapping these changes have primarily relied on empirical analyses of formal policy and political processes. This case-study of Sweden takes an alternative route, and analyses a dataset of 1405 Swedish newspaper articles (1985-2019) using a new institutional theory and social movement theory framework. Therethrough, the paper is able to provide new insights into the emergence and development of an institutional issue field concerned with the prevention of terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation. More specifically, the paper highlights the unstable, fragmented, dynamic and contested character of the field's development. Frames containing the problems and solutions considered most important during each of the field's five stages are identified, and the subsequent institutional and organisational consequences are discussed. The paper also considers how terror attacks and other extremism-related events impact the institutionalisation and alternation of dominant frames, and identifies the translation and development of an inclusive vocabulary as pivotal to mobilising a broad and diverse set of actors to co-produce preventive efforts.},

How aid is framed by donors directly affects levels of public support. Purpose The article investigates support for aid among English-speaking Canadians, and how this varies by the framing of aid spending, socioeconomic markers, personal values and political engagement. Approach and methods Statistical analysis is undertaken of data from a representative survey of English-speaking Canadians on their knowledge and attitudes with respect to aid to developing countries. A particular focus of the analysis is the influence of the framing of aid spending on public support for aid spending, while controlling for the influence of socioeconomic factors. Findings Support for increased spending rises when spending is framed relative to the size of the economy, whether in dollar or percentage terms, rather than when framed relative to government taxation or spending. Providing information on the current level of aid spending also raises support for increased aid spending. Overall, when informed about the level of aid spending, most respondents support maintaining or increasing aid. Views on aid vary little by age, education and other socioeconomic markers. People's values, however, did affect support for aid. Respondents who believe in "Canada first" were considerably more likely to support aid cuts than others. Those who see kindness as part of Canadian identity tend to favour aid, while those who see economic prosperity as part of national identity tend to want aid cuts. While voting intention does not affect views on aid, respondents who have been either politically active or involved in collective action on media/social media are a little more likely to favour increased aid. Policy implications The findings confirm the importance of the framing of aid spending for designing and implementing programmes to inform, engage and elicit support from the public. Given how values influence public support for aid, engagement needs to be tailored to different target audiences.},

	abstract = {Media coverage of climate protests within the United States and internationally has shown growing public frustration about governmental responses to climate change. But what are the effects of conveying that people are angry? And how do they contrast with more traditional norm messages about climate policy support? Here, we investigate whether social norm messaging about collective anger can impact perceptions of consensus and public support for climate mitigation. In a pilot study and two survey experiments (total N = 1529), we find that relative to control messages, normative appeals that convey growing public anger about U.S. inaction on climate change (i.e., dynamic anger consensus messaging) can enhance Americans' consensus estimates of other Americans' climate-related beliefs and support for mitigation policy, and expectations for future climatemitigating collective action. Moreover, exposure to a dynamic anger consensus message led to similar estimates of Americans' policy support and belief in climate change as messages that explicitly conveyed public support for climate mitigation (Study 1) or consensus belief in anthropogenic climate change (Study 2). When tailored for a cross-partisan audience, anger consensus messaging was also effective in bolstering personal support for climate mitigation (Study 2). Notably, similar effects were observed across partisan groups. These findings suggest that, by signaling shared motivational states, emotion consensus appeals can enhance expectations for social change, with the potential to mobilize bipartisan support for climate mitigation.},

This article uses survey and protest event data to assess the spatial and temporal effect of mobilizations on political attitudes Chile. It combines the 2008, 2010, and 2012 LAPOP surveys and a dataset of college student protest events, mapping respondents and protests at the municipal level using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Using regression analyses, it finds that proximity to college student protests has a significant effect on various political attitudes. The effect, however, tends to be substantively larger on "weak" attitudes and smaller on "strong" ones. The results highlight the importance of mobilizations in shaping individual political attitudes and the role that social movements play in the policy-making process.},

There is robust empirical evidence in the literature, showing that organizational structure in the workplace determines social ties among workers, and these pre-existing ties are likely to have an effect on workers' commitment to and participation in a strike. However, this empirical literature is limited in the sense that it does not consider the evolution of social networks during organizing and strikes. Therefore, this study seeks to understand the effect of collective action on interpersonal relations among the participants, and the role of these ties on future strike participation. The main contribution of this article is to empirically show that social networks during a strike are dynamic, and participation in a strike is very much a function of these networks. We also show that propinquity and network intentionality were important tie formation mechanisms in the picket lines. The implications of these findings for organizers and trade-offs between hierarchical and decentralized mobilizations are also discussed.},

We conducted a two-wave panel study before and after the Bersih 5 protests demanding electoral reform (N = 422), and another two-wave panel study before and after the 14th General Elections which were historic in unseating the ruling government (N = 386). Against mounting corruption, the two events were important to Malaysia's democratic transition. Across both studies, alternative media consumption was linked to more positive attitudes toward the Bersih movement, especially among people who were strong supporters of the previous ruling government. Mainstream media did not play a consistent role in shaping attitudes toward the movement, nor was there evidence of backlash among government supporters. Thus, alternative media may have legitimized the cause for social change.},

The framing of economic inequality in news coverage is important to understand as news frames can shape public opinion and subsequently policy responses to inequality. There is no research we are aware of that documents how economic inequality is framed in the news. We compiled a dataset of 2109 news articles, published between 2000 and 2014, about economic inequality, and conducted a detailed content analysis.

Research about how news frames are shaped by contextual factors in the production of news is uncertain about which factors matter and to what extent. The dataset has a set of features that allow us to simultaneously examine a number of potential determinants of news frames. Our data allow us to compare the relative influences on news coverage of economic inequality of (1) national context, (2) the political leaning of newspapers, (3) changing economic conditions, and (4) social movement efforts. Of these four factors, we find that only the Occupy movement influenced the volume of attention and the identification of economic inequality as a problem with negative consequences. National context, political leaning, and change in economic conditions had much more limited, or no, influence. Following the emergence of the Occupy movement, attention to economic inequality increased and remained higher than before. However, despite the clear effects of the Occupy movement on problem identification, news coverage of the causes and solutions to economic inequality did not significantly shift. We, therefore, find that social movement activity had the clearest influence on news frames, but the observed effect in this case was superficial rather than detailed.},

	abstract = {Introduction. The article is devoted to the analysis of the protest political mobilization in the regional political space of Volgograd region. Particular attention is paid to the study of the main conditions and causes of protest activity in the context of implementing public policy in Volgograd region. The relevance of the problem field is due to the need for a political analysis of the characteristics of the population mobilization at the regional level, including their comparison with federal trends. Methodology and methods. The authors conceptualize political mobilization on the basis of the theoretical principles of the theory of collective behavior of G. Blumer, E. Hoffer, T. Garr and the rational basis for the mobilization of D. Gupt. The methodological basis of the study is the theory of collective action (Ch. Tilly), on the basis of which it is concluded that political mobilization is defined as a combination of institutional and social conditions that allow actors to rationally evaluate transaction costs and possible gains from mobilization actions. The analysis of the regional public policy system is based on the conclusions contained in the works of Yu.O. Gaivoronsky, S.I. Morozov, S.A. Pankratov. The empirical basis of the study is the public opinion polls of the Levada Center, expert and analytical materials on the state of protest activity of the Institute of Regional Expertise, as well as the results of monitoring data from Internet resources obtained with the direct participation of the authors in March 2020. Analysis. The modern Russian socio-political system is a synthesis of two opposites: a hermetically "closed" institutional political structure, which is determined by the situation of internal uncertainty, and an active social component. At the same time, the specifics of the regional public space of Volgograd Region is a combination of the subject composition of the institutional design of the regional political regime based on copying the features of the federal regime, as well as the diversity of the regional themes of socio-political protest. Based on the results obtained by the case-study method, it was found that the protest dynamics in Volgograd region show a downward trend, however, any manifestations of public protest activity in the region implicitly imply a political nature in direct proportion to the number of participants: the greater the number of participants in the protest stocks, the higher the degree of its politicization. Results.

	abstract = {Introduction. The article is devoted to the analysis of the protest political mobilization in the regional political space of Volgograd region. Particular attention is paid to the study of the main conditions and causes of protest activity in the context of implementing public policy in Volgograd region. The relevance of the problem field is due to the need for a political analysis of the characteristics of the population mobilization at the regional level, including their comparison with federal trends. Methodology and methods. The authors conceptualize political mobilization on the basis of the theoretical principles of the theory of collective behavior of G. Blumer, E. Hoffer, T. Garr and the rational basis for the mobilization of D. Gupt. The methodological basis of the study is the theory of collective action (Ch. Tilly), on the basis of which it is concluded that political mobilization is defined as a combination of institutional and social conditions that allow actors to rationally evaluate transaction costs and possible gains from mobilization actions. The analysis of the regional public policy system is based on the conclusions contained in the works of Yu.O. Gaivoronsky, S.I. Morozov, S.A. Pankratov. The empirical basis of the study is the public opinion polls of the Levada Center, expert and analytical materials on the state of protest activity of the Institute of Regional Expertise, as well as the results of monitoring data from Internet resources obtained with the direct participation of the authors in March 2020. Analysis. The modern Russian socio-political system is a synthesis of two opposites: a hermetically "closed" institutional political structure, which is determined by the situation of internal uncertainty, and an active social component. At the same time, the specifics of the regional public space of Volgograd Region is a combination of the subject composition of the institutional design of the regional political regime based on copying the features of the federal regime, as well as the diversity of the regional themes of socio-political protest. Based on the results obtained by the case-study method, it was found that the protest dynamics in Volgograd region show a downward trend, however, any manifestations of public protest activity in the region implicitly imply a political nature in direct proportion to the number of participants: the greater the number of participants in the protest stocks, the higher the degree of its politicization. Results. According to the results of the study, it was revealed that the protest political mobilization in the public space of Volgograd region is characterized by: firstly, the prevalence of regional problems over federal ones in the protest discourse; secondly, the lack of strong institutional structures that can mobilize material and organizational resources; thirdly, a critically low number of protesters; fourthly, the spontaneous nature of mobilization. A special feature of political mobilization in the regional dimension is the low social potential of the protest and the lack of effective mechanisms for political and communicative interaction between government institutions and the population of Volgograd region on a specific range of problems of a public nature. In order to overcome the shortcomings of dialogue communication, within the framework of representative democracy, the authors propose recommendations for the main actors of the public political space (regional authorities, expert community and civil society institutions).},

Yet ESPA was never able to mount comparable efforts for its long-standing commitment to transgender rights before disbanding in 2015, despite the fact that marriage equality was less widely supported than transgender rights in ESPA's own public opinion polling. In-depth interviews reveal that ESPA was constrained by the class and personal interests of its affluent major donors, mainly high-income gay white men. The organization's abrupt closure provided an unusual opportunity to research the often secret topic of major donor influence, as frustrated former staff were willing to be frank in interviews. ESPA was only able to successfully campaign on issues that were especially compelling for these donors, and was forced to close when its legislative agenda diverged from their interests. This case suggests class interests and access to resources shape the causal impact of collective identities on social movement dynamics.},

	abstract = {New York State's largest gay rights organization, the Empire State Pride Agenda (ESPA), won significant legislative victories, including the legalization of same sex marriage in 2011. Yet ESPA was never able to mount comparable efforts for its long-standing commitment to transgender rights before disbanding in 2015, despite the fact that marriage equality was less widely supported than transgender rights in ESPA's own public opinion polling. In-depth interviews reveal that ESPA was constrained by the class and personal interests of its affluent major donors, mainly high-income gay white men. The organization's abrupt closure provided an unusual opportunity to research the often secret topic of major donor influence, as frustrated former staff were willing to be frank in interviews. ESPA was only able to successfully campaign on issues that were especially compelling for these donors, and was forced to close when its legislative agenda diverged from their interests. This case suggests class interests and access to resources shape the causal impact of collective identities on social movement dynamics.},

The Quebec student movement succeeded not by garnering public support or directly influencing policy decisions, but by allying itself with an opposition party that won an election in spite of its association with the movement. The student movement was not backed by popular opinion, and its success resulted from aligning itself with a party that was able to withstand the detrimental effects of this relationship.},

What explains the success of the 2012 Quebec student protests? This paper argues that the unfolding of political events in 2012 demonstrates the counter-intuitive manner in which a state can come to reflect a social movement's objectives. The Quebec student movement succeeded not by garnering public support or directly influencing policy decisions, but by allying itself with an opposition party that won an election in spite of its association with the movement. The student movement was not backed by popular opinion, and its success resulted from aligning itself with a party that was able to withstand the detrimental effects of this relationship.},

	abstract = {Legal and sociolegal scholars have argued that social movement litigation often generates social change indirectly by drawing publicity and public attention to movement issues. Yet some cases are more likely than others to receive coverage in the mainstream news media particularly those cases involving conflict or controversy, which resonate with established definitions of "newsworthiness." This Article empirically examines bias in the news media's coverage of social movement litigation through a case study of the LGBT movement, which compares the content of the litigation dockets of three major LGBT civil rights organizations to the content of newspaper coverage of those organizations from 1996-2006. The time period examined in this study offers a unique opportunity to investigate bias in media coverage of movement litigation. This period marks the formative first decade after LGBT rights organizations began to take part in litigation for marriage equality, an issue which has since become an essential part of the LGBT movement's public narrative. As movement litigators during these years tentatively asserted the right for same-sex couples to marry in a few select state courts, they were met with an intense conservative backlash targeting both same-sex marriage as a goal and the impact litigation strategies being used to achieve it. In examining LGBT movement litigation during this period of intense controversy around same -sex marriage, this Article illuminates the role of countermovements in shaping media constructions and broader popular interpretations of social movement litigation. Findings from the study reveal that the news media reported more extensively on the LGBT movement's marriage equality litigation than on any other issue. This coverage was drastically disproportionate to the small percentage of marriage equality cases on the LGBT legal organizations' dockets during this time period. In addition, news articles on same-sex marriage litigation were significantly more likely than other articles to discuss anti-LGBT countermovement activity. These findings suggest that countermovement mobilization against same-sex marriage, dubbed a "culture war" in the media, may have created conflict that reporters found particularly newsworthy leading the news media to focus attention on one of the LGBT movement's most contentious litigation campaigns. I explore the implications of these findings in shaping the course of social movement mobilization, countermobilization, and the possibilities for social change.},

	abstract = {During the 1990s, research activities to characterise environmental health risks grew significantly in France, providing useful tools for policy-makers in this field. Research into the management of these risks also exists, but is neither coherent on a national scale nor sufficient to deal with the issues created by the accelerated production of potentially anxiety-inducing scientific information. This article focuses on the study of public policies in environmental health and is intended to contribute to development of knowledge in this domain. Reviewing explanatory approaches to the construction of public risk management policies reveals three broad categories: "type of risk" or technical approaches that focus on ways to transform scientific knowledge into decision tools; "public preferences and attitudes' approaches, which suggest that risk management policies are determined (or should be) by public demands; and "interest group" approaches arguing that risk regimes are the product of the influences of various organised interests. Christopher Hood has developed a method to assess the relative weight of these approaches in actual risk regulation regimes, depending on situations and types of risks, and to analyse these regimes and compare those expected for each approach. We apply this method to French risk management policies for three risks - waterborne lead, exposure to Legionella in hotels, and exposure to asbestos in buildings. Conclusions of this explanatory exercise are consistent with Hood's findings and point out the major relevance of the "interest groups" model, except in the area of asbestos, for which anticipation of public opinion seems to dominate.

That the passions and interests of real people often divert them from pursuing the common good confronted them with a dilemma: what is desired by all is not necessarily what reason shows to be in their general interest. The dilemma points to the necessity of government and also of institutional arrangements to mediate between the people and the makers of laws binding on everyone. The paper examines in particular the views of Rousseau on assemblies, of Hegel on the development of universal norms, and of von Stein on social movement. It concludes that public opinion exists only in the form of discourse and that it exerts influence either when some part acts as a concrete group or when the preferences of an abstract aggregate of individuals converge on a particular party, candidate, or legislative proposal.},

A conclusão geral é a de que é necessário um conceito de movimentos sociais que consiga dar conta da unidade e diversidade desse fenômeno, tal como o que foi apresentado no artigo, e que este momento precisa ser complementado pela análise da diversidade, o que remente para o caso dos movimentos sociais específicos.

I propose the concept of agenda seeding to describe how activists use methods like disruption to capture the attention of media and overcome political asymmetries. Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6–2.5\%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward “social control.” In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9\% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. Elites may dominate political communication but hold no monopoly.},

	abstract = {How do stigmatized minorities advance agendas when confronted with hostile majorities? Elite theories of influence posit marginal groups exert little power. I propose the concept of agenda seeding to describe how activists use methods like disruption to capture the attention of media and overcome political asymmetries. Further, I hypothesize protest tactics influence how news organizations frame demands. Evaluating black-led protests between 1960 and 1972, I find nonviolent activism, particularly when met with state or vigilante repression, drove media coverage, framing, congressional speech, and public opinion on civil rights. Counties proximate to nonviolent protests saw presidential Democratic vote share increase 1.6–2.5\%. Protester-initiated violence, by contrast, helped move news agendas, frames, elite discourse, and public concern toward “social control.” In 1968, using rainfall as an instrument, I find violent protests likely caused a 1.5–7.9\% shift among whites toward Republicans and tipped the election. Elites may dominate political communication but hold no monopoly.},

O estudo foi desenvolvido no Núcleo de Extensão em Desenvolvimento Territorial do Território Rural de Identidade Rio Machado (NEDET Rio Machado), sediado no Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia de Rondônia (IFRO). Seu objetivo principal foi analisar a percepção de segurança alimentar e nutricional de mulheres residentes em São Felipe d’Oeste, município amazônico integrante daquele Território. Buscou-se ainda identificar onde a insegurança alimentar e nutricional tem maior incidência: se na zona urbana ou rural, bem como discutir os fatores que interagem para sua formação e mitigação. A pesquisa foi desenvolvida em abordagem qualitativa, mediante observação de tipo participante, em campo, e aplicação da Escala Brasileira de Insegurança Alimentar e Nutricional - EBIA. A amostra compreendeu 2\% da população total do referido município, da qual metade foi constituída de mulheres residentes na Zona Rural e a outra metade de mulheres residentes na Zona Urbana. As análises tomaram por base Menezes e Carneiro (1997), Bourdieu (2002), Butler (2017), Kepple e Segall-Corrêa (2011), dentre outros. Os resultados apontam que a insegurança alimentar e nutricional teve incidência maior na zona urbana do que na zona rural, contribuindo para a melhor situação da segunda a forte ocupação das mulheres na agricultura familiar de base agroecológica.},

As conferências internacionais promovidas pela Organização das Nações Unidas recomendam ações para eliminar as discriminações contra o sexo feminino em todos os campos de atividade, especialmente na educação. O hiato de gênero e o déficit educacional das mulheres sempre fizeram parte da realidade brasileira. Contudo, as mulheres conseguiram eliminar e reverter esse hiato ao longo do século XX. Este artigo tem como objetivo principal analisar quando se deu a reversão do hiato de gênero na educação no Brasil. Para isso, apresentaremos as informações educacionais dos censos demográficos de 1960 a 2000, segundo níveis de escolaridade, desagregadas por sexo e por coortes de nascimento. Essa metodologia nos permitirá acompanhar a evolução do hiato de gênero das coortes nascidas após 1890 até o ano 1995.

            The reduction of the gender gap and the improvement in female access to education were explicit objectives of the IV Conference on Women (1995), of the World Education Forum (2000) and of the Millennium Summit (2000). All International Conferences promoted by the United Nations Organization (UN) recommend actions to eradicate discrimination against women in all fields of activity, especially education. The gender gap and the education deficit among women have always been part of the Brazilian reality. However, women have been able to eliminate and reverse this gap throughout the 20th century. The main purpose of this article is to analyze when the reversion of the gender gap in Brazilian education occurred. In order to do so, we will present information obtained from demographic censuses from 1960 to 2000, based on schooling levels disaggregated by gender and birth cohorts. This methodology will allow us to track the evolution of the gender gap in birth cohorts after 1890 until 1995.},

The objective is to analyze the contribution of the Programa Nacional Mulheres Mil’s to reduce vulnerability to food insecurity of households headed by woman. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to 384 participants, which contained the demographic and socioeconomic variables as well as the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. It was observed that, although there was no change in the Food Security situation, there were significant differences in relation to income, especially among women in situation of food insecurity, varying from 20.5\% to 46\% the number of participants with an income range higher than one minimum wage. The advance in the identified income was not enough to intervene in Food Insecurity. Further research should be carried out in order to deepen the understanding of the relationships between income, education and food and nutritional security, especially from the point of view of actions directed at the female gender.},

O objetivo principal é compreender como homens e mulheres, brancos, pretos ou pardos, buscam atendimento médico na Atenção Primária à Saúde, porta de entrada no sistema de saúde brasileiro. As análises sob uma perspectiva de gênero mostram que padrões culturais e sociais afetam ações e escolhas individuais e, em particular, o acesso e uso dos serviços de saúde. Os resultados também indicam que homens e mulheres reproduzem o comportamento de gênero esperado, social e culturalmente construído, que impacta sua autoavaliação de estado de saúde, cuidados e suas exposições ao risco de doença e morte. A análise interseccional revela que as desigualdades raciais se combinam às observadas entre homens e mulheres, exponenciando vulnerabilidades para pessoas de cor ou raça preta ou parda e refletindo as desigualdades socioeconômicas estruturantes da sociedade brasileira. Nesse contexto, a universalidade e a integralidade preconizadas no Sistema Único de Saúde contribuem enquanto política pública para a garantia de direitos, equalização de oportunidades e efetivação do acesso ao atendimento igualitário.

            Abstract This paper aims to evaluate gender and racial inequalities in the access and use of health services in Brazil Based on the 2019 National Health Survey (PNS). Its main objective is to understand how white, black, or brown men and women seek medical care in Primary Health Care, the gateway to the Brazilian health system. Analyses from a gender perspective show that cultural and social patterns affect individual actions and choices and mainly access to and use of health services. The results also show that men and women reproduce the expected gender behavior, socially and culturally constructed, which impacts their self-assessment of health status, care, and their exposure to the risk of disease and death. The intersectional analysis reveals that racial inequalities are aligned with those observed between men and women, exponentiating vulnerabilities for self-identified black or brown people, reflecting the structural socioeconomic inequalities of Brazilian society. In this context, the universality and integrality recommended in the Unified Health System contribute as a public policy to the guarantee of rights, equalization of opportunities, and adequate access to equal care.},

	url = {https://lume.ufrgs.br/handle/10183/169725},
	abstract = {Introdução: O tema Segurança Alimentar é uma preocupação crescente para a saúde pública em todo o mundo, uma vez que as consequências da insegurança alimentar afetam os diversos setores da sociedade. A renda tem sido fortemente correlacionada com a insegurança alimentar. No entanto, renda e pobreza não são os únicos responsáveis por predizer situações de insegurança alimentar, sugerindo que outros fatores socioeconômicos e de composição da unidade domiciliar também são importantes na determinação desse desfecho. Estudos internacionais têm sugerido que domicílios chefiados por mulheres estão mais propensos à insegurança alimentar (IA) do que aqueles chefiados por homens. Considerando o crescente número de famílias onde a pessoa de referência é do sexo feminino e a desvantagem econômica decorrente do papel social da mulher, as questões de gênero merecem atenção especial nas discussões sobre insegurança alimentar. Objetivos: O objetivo geral foi avaliar as diferenças de gênero na prevalência de insegurança alimentar. Nesse sentido, a presente tese propôs os dois seguintes objetivos específicos: a) identificar, por meio de revisão sistemática e metanálise, as prevalências de insegurança alimentar em nível internacional segundo o gênero do responsável pelo domicílio (artigo 1); e b) estudar a influência de fatores individuais socioeconômicos e demográficos na prevalência domiciliar de insegurança alimentar, segundo gênero do responsável pelo domicílio, nas 27 unidades da federação do Brasil no ano de 2013 (artigo 2). Metodologia: Com o intuito de atender os objetivos acima citadas foram desenvolvidos dois estudos com metodologias diferentes, porém complementares. No artigo 1, realizou-se uma revisão sistemática de estudos de prevalência, seguida de metanálise, no período compreendido entre 28 de Agosto e 19 de Outubro de 2014. Foram pesquisadas sete base de dados. A busca foi atualizada em Abril de 2016. Os estudos incluídos fizeram uso de medidas diretas da experiência de insegurança alimentar. O desfecho foi dicotomizado. O odds ratio agrupado da prevalência domiciliar de insegurança alimentar em mulheres versus homens foi obtido através de modelo randômico. Foram realizadas análises da avaliação da qualidade, viés de publicação e análise de subgrupo. O artigo 2 trata-se de um estudo de base populacional cujos dados foram extraídos do suplemento de Segurança Alimentar da Pesquisa Nacional de Amostras de Domicílios, ano 2013. Foram estudados os domicílios particulares permanentes nos quais a EBIA havia sido 9 respondida por um morador do domicílio (n=110.750). A associação entre as variáveis de exposição e a variável dependente (insegurança alimentar domiciliar) foi verificada pelo teste do Qui-quadrado com nível de significância de 5\%. Foram calculadas razões de prevalência brutas e intervalos de confiança de 95\% e a análise ajustada foi conduzida por meio de regressão múltipla de Poisson Bruta, utilizando Stata 11.0, que incorpora as ponderações do desenho amostral com delineamento complexo. Resultados: No artigo 1, das 5.145 referências inicialmente identificadas, 42 artigos foram incluídos na metanálise, totalizando uma população de 233.153 indivíduos. Os resultados mostraram que a probabilidade de insegurança alimentar foi 40\% maior naqueles estudos em que o entrevistado era a mulher (IC95\%: 1.27-1.54; p{\textless}0.001). Além disso, a análise de subgrupo revelou que as mulheres responsáveis pelo domicílio estavam 75\% mais propensas à insegurança alimentar do que os homens na mesma condição. No artigo 2, constatou-se que a prevalência global de insegurança alimentar, em 2013, foi de 7,9\%, sendo maior em domicílios chefiados por mulheres (9,5\%) do que naqueles chefiados por homens (7,0\%). Constataram-se maiores prevalências de IA entre os domicílios chefiados por mulheres e um efeito menos intenso das variáveis independentes nesse gênero. Na análise ajustada verificou-se que a prevalência de insegurança alimentar permaneceu maior (RP=1.26, IC95\% 1.20-1.33) entre domicílios chefiados por mulheres, independentemente do modelo de análise utilizado. Conclusão: Em ambos os artigos, foi possível confirmar a existência de diferenças de gênero na prevalência de insegurança alimentar em nível nacional e mundial. Ou seja, os resultados mostraram maiores prevalências de insegurança alimentar entre os domicílios chefiados por mulheres.},

Neste ensaio teórico, refletimos sobre as limitações dos critérios econômicos para o debate sobre o trabalho de baixa renda nos estudos organizacionais brasileiros.

            Abstract What we know about the low-wage work and the low-wage worker in Brazil? Probably the economic criterion will be used to derive a more objective response: the level of income what they have. Alone, this response neglects that low-wage work is performed by a certain workers group that have many problems to access another labour reality, in the face of a series of social preconditions that make the precariousness of work into something premature and durable in their lives. In this theoretical essay, we reflect on the limitations of economic criteria for the debate on the work of low-income Brazilians in organizational studies. As a result, we indicate some implications for research practice.},

	abstract = {This article explores the causes and consequences of extreme non-viable candidacies, also known as “ laranja ” (orange) candidacies in the Brazilian political lore. We first define and delineate what makes a candidate a laranja, engaging the comparative literature on sacrificial lambs and using district-level electoral results to operationalize the concept. We then advance a typology of laranjas with four ideal types that vary along dimensions of legality and intentionality. Next, we apply descriptive statistics and a hierarchical logistic regression model to explore the individual, party, and district-level characteristics of extreme non-viable candidates and assess whether and how laranjas are distinct from non- laranjas. Finally, we illustrate the gendered character of laranjas, documenting how the candidate gender quota law in Brazil has been associated with a proliferation of candidatas laranjas (women extreme non-viable candidates).

            Resumen Este artículo explora las causas y las consecuencias de las candidaturas no viables, también conocido como “candidaturas de fachada,” que se han vuelto parte del folclor político en Brasil. Definimos y delimitamos en primer lugar lo que hace de una candidatura de fachada, relacionando en la literatura comparada con sacrificial lambs, para luego pasar a los resultados electorales a nivel de distrito y los datos financieros de las campañas para operacionalizar el concepto. A continuación, proponemos una tipología de la candidatura de fachada con cuatro tipos específicos que varían entre dimensiones de la legalidad e la intencionalidad. Se presentan las estadísticas descriptivas además de un modelo logístico jerárquico para explorar el individuo, partido, y las características a nivel de distrito de los candidatos no viables y evaluar si y cómo las candidaturas de fachada son distintos de aquellos que no lo son. Por último, se expone el carácter de género de las candidaturas de fachada, documentando cómo la ley de cuotas de género en Brasil se ha asociado a una proliferación de candidatas de fachada (candidatas extremamente no viables).

            Resumo Este artigo explora as causas e consequências de candidaturas extremamente não viáveis, também chamadas de “candidaturas laranjas”, no folclore político do Brasil. Nós procuramos definir, primeiramente, o que torna uma candidatura a ser identificada como laranja, empregando a literatura comparada sobre sacrificial lambs, mas também envolvendo os resultados eleitorais de cada distrito para operacionalizar o conceito no contexto brasileiro. Em seguida, nós propomos uma tipologia da candidatura laranja com quatro tipos específicos que variam entre dimensões da legalidade e da intencionalidade. A seguir, apresentamos estatísticas descritivas e um modelo logístico hierárquico que explora as características individuais, partidárias, e do distrito entre candidaturas não viáveis a fim de avaliar se, e como, candidaturas ditas laranjas são distintas das não laranjas. Finalmente, ilustramos o caráter de gênero das candidaturas laranjas, documentando como a lei sobre cotas de gênero no Brasil está associada ao aumento do número de candidatas laranjas.

            Résumé Cet article explore les causes et les conséquences de cette tendance des candidatures extrêmement non viables, aussi connues sous le nom de “candidatures laranjas ” dans la tradition politique brésilienne. Nous définissons tout d'abord ce qui fait d’un candidat un “laranja”, en utilisant la littérature comparative sur les “ sacrificial lambs ”, pour ensuite utiliser les résultats des élections au niveau du district pour opérationnaliser le concept. Ensuite, nous avançons une typologie de “Laranja” avec quatre types idéals qui varient par leurs dimensions de la légalité et de l’intentionnalité. Nous appliquons ensuite des statistiques descriptives et un modèle logistique hiérarchique pour explorer les caractéristiques individuelles, de parti et de district des candidatures extrêmement non viables et pour évaluer si et comment les “laranjas” sont distincts des “non-laranjas”. Enfin, nous illustrons le caractère sexospécifique des “laranjas” et nous informons la façon dont la loi sur les quotas de genre dans la politique au Brésil a été associée à une prolifération de ce type de candidatures.},

	abstract = {O artigo discute a estruturação da carreira política no Brasil, com atenção especial para os meios de comunicação de massa. Na medida em que se tornou uma fonte crucial de produção de capital político, os meios de comunicação geram "atalhos" na carreira política, permitindo que outsiders ganhem posições que, numa carreira fechada, só seriam acessíveis a integrantes experientes do campo político, com ampla vivência em cargos de menor importância. À luz dessa discussão, é examinada a trajetória dos deputados federais eleitos em quatro legislaturas, observando a força - e as limitações - da influência dos meios de comunicação, analisando-se mais atentamente aqueles deputados eleitos pela primeira vez e sem experiência eleitoral e administrativa prévia. O artigo conclui que, de modo geral, a exposição nos meios de comunicação é uma variável importante, ainda que a atividade profissional originária dos candidatos também seja uma variável a considerar.

            This article looks at the way political careers are structured in Brazil, paying special attention to mass communications. To the extent that they have become a crucial source for the production of political capital, the mass media create "shortcuts" in a political career, enabling outsiders access to positions that, in a more closed race, would only be open to experienced members of the political field who are making their way up from wide experience in minor positions. In light of this discussion, we examine the trajectory of federal representatives elected in four legislatures, observing the strength - and the limitations - of the influence of mass media, paying closest attention to those who have been elected for the first time and without previous electoral and administrative experience. The article concludes that, generally speaking, exposure through mass communications is an important variable, although the candidates' original professional activity is also an important variable to consider.

            L'article discute la structure de la carrière politique au Brésil et met en relief le rôle des moyens de communications massives. Comme les médias sont devenus une source cruciale de production de capital politique, ils favorisent des «raccourcis» dans la carrière politique et permettent que outsiders aient des positions qui ne seraient accessibles dans une carrière fermée qu'aux membres avertis du cadre politique et ayant une large expérience dans des postes de moindre importance. Cette discussion nous aide à examiner la trajectoire des députés nationaux élus à quatre reprises: on observe la force - et les limites - de l'influence des moyens de communication et on analyse avec attention les députés élus pour la première fois et sans expérience électorale et administrative. L'article conclut que souvent l'exposition aux moyens de communications est une variable importante, bien que l'activité professionnelle d'origine des candidats soit aussi une variable à être prise en compte.},

Com base em um questionário constando perguntas relativas a diferentes dimensões individuais e institucionais em relação aos partidos, analisa-se dimensões como trajetórias políticas e eleitorais, estratégias, recursos e dificuldades de campanhas. Em seguida, por meio de determinados procedimentos metodológicos de aglomeração de variáveis, procura-se analisar perfis de eleitos e não eleitos. O objetivo é identificar como o gênero perpassa e apresenta-se em possíveis variáveis intervenientes nesses perfis. Como os resultados mostram, há varias dimensões nas quais a categoria gênero faz-se presente, de maneira direta ou indireta, em geral, antes do momento eleitoral em si. O processo eleitoral seria, assim, o resultado de um filtro que antecede mesmo o recrutamento. Conclui-se que os perfis de eleitos, homens ou mulheres, são semelhantes, mas, considerando que os homens são amplamente majoritários entre os eleitos, pode-se dizer que tais perfis são fruto de uma estrutura ainda marcada por desigualdades e por valores diferenciados por gênero.

            This article presents the main results of a survey of candidates to Parliament, conducted within the research developed by the Consortium Bertha Lutz during the 2010 elections. It examines dimensions such as political trajectories and electoral strategies, resources and difficulties campaigns. The objective is to identify how gender is presented in possible intervening variables in these profiles. For this work we used two data sources: a survey sampling based on a structured questionnaire consisting questions regarding various individual and institutional dimensions, applied to Congress candidates in 14 states, and the data provided by applicants to the Superior Electoral Court . The statistical analysis for verification of hypotheses based on the Cluster Analysis. The results indicate that being male is associated with being or have already been parliamentary, be trying to re-election, have a reasonable time of political, owning militancy and have invested large resources in the election campaign. On the other hand, for a woman to have a campaign promising she should have a good political career and being inserted into social networking strategies. Based on the data, it is concluded that the strategy to achieve gender equality in Congress should follow these points: the parties, through consolidation of party experience, job positions public political forms of association and / or militancy and structuring networks or personal representative and, above all, availability of financial resources, or through personal networks and donations. The election process would therefore a result of a preceding filter even recruitment. Profiles elected, whether men or women, are similar, but as far as men are widely majority among the elect, we can say that these profiles are the result of a structure still marked by inequalities and values differentiated by gender.},

A partir desta análise, estabeleceram-se critérios empíricos para a mensuração da democracia interna nos partidos políticos. Para tanto, aplicamos um survey a 120 candidatos à deputado federal nas eleições de 2010. O marco de análise utilizado foi o proposto por Freidenberg (2003) para a definição e mensuração de democracia interna e Hazan e Rahat (2010) para o processo de seleção de candidatos. A hipótese é que seleções mais inclusivas e realizadas por meio de votação produzem partidos mais democráticos. Os resultados apontam que partidos com participação de instâncias organizativas médias (como delegados) e que mobilizam o voto para a tomada de decisão nem sempre apresentam melhores índices de representatividade.

The framework for analisys was the proposed by Freidenberg (2003) for the definition and measure of internal democracy and Hazan e Rahat (2010) for the candidate selection process. The hypothesis stands for more inclusive selections and done by vote, produces more democratic parties. The results points out that political parties with middle strata´s organizational participation, as delegates, and mobilize the vote for the decision making process, not always presents better representative index. In the other hand, political parties selects thier candidates em very different way, independent from institutional constraint. Thesse differences ocurred essentialy regards the inclusiviness and the nomination shape. This points out that the electoral system isn't the exclusive determinant of the party behavior.},

Os dados apresentados provém de uma diversidade de fontes e privilegiaram os processos de inclusão de mulheres em diferentes tipos de democracias e sociedades.

Além disso, os dados nos permitiram desvendar um incremento da participação das bases sociais do partido no processo de nominação de candidatos. Concluímos que o processo de seleção de candidatos é uma das mais técnicas e privadas funções dos partidos políticos.

Entre essas funções está a de articulação entre os cidadãos e as esferas de poder político, que acontece, especialmente, por meio do processo de seleção de candidatos a cargos eletivos. Mas quais são os efeitos do processo de seleção de candidatos sobre a competição política para a Câmara dos Deputados no Brasil? Com o objetivo de responder a essa questão, o artigo cumpre com uma dupla tarefa: Identificar os fatores que teoricamente afetam o processo de seleção de candidatos a cargos eletivos proporcionais, e suas consequências para o sistema partidário; e verificar qual é o controle que as lideranças dos partidos analisados apresentam sobre a composição da lista partidária. Para cumprirmos os objetivos levantados, analisamos os dados relativos às eleições para a Câmara dos Deputados, no estado de São Paulo, em 2006 e 2010. Mostramos que há uma coordenação que envolve o número de candidatos, o espaço geográfico em que competem e o seu perfil socioocupacional, além da própria distribuição de recursos partidários. O trabalho aponta que os partidos brasileiros não são tão fracos e desorganizados como parte da literatura indica. Sugerimos que os partidos são capazes de agir de maneira coordenada nas eleições para a Câmara, estabelecendo estratégias de acordo com elementos mais conjunturais (a perspectiva de contar com "puxadores" de votos, por exemplo) ou estruturais (a necessidade de organizar a lista geográfica e socialmente para coordenar recursos).

            Political parties are still essential for the good functioning of democratic regimes. One key role performed by the parties is the connection between citizens and diferent areas of political power, performed, among others, by the process of candidate selection. But what are the effects of the candidate selection process to the political competition to the Brazilian Chamber? To answer this question, this paper has two aims: Identify the aspects that affect the candidate selection process and its consequences to the party system; Analyze the control of the leadership over the candidate list. In order to do that, we analyze the data related to the elections of 2006 and 2010 to the Chamber in the state of São Paulo. We show the existence of a coordination involving the number of candidates, their profile and their electoral strongholds. The paper points that Brazilian parties are not weak and disorganized as part of the literature implies and suggests that they are capable of building electoral strategies taking into consideration both structural needs and the political scenario.},

Este artigo analisa as trajetórias políticas dos eleitos para a Câmara dos Deputados brasileira nas últimas três eleições (2002, 2006 e 2010), observando a presença de diferentes tipos de capital político originário, em particular o familiar. Os dados mostram que a presença de família política é a segunda via principal de acesso à Câmara, depois apenas do capital econômico.

            La carrera política suele ser marcada, tanto en Brasil como en otros países, por un fuerte carácter endógeno. Muchos políticos hacen su carrera a través de sus padres, cónyuges u otros parientes cercanos que ocupan puestos electivos o funciones de destaque en el Poder Ejecutivo. Este artículo analiza las trayectorias políticas de los elegidos para la Cámara de los Diputados en Brasil en las últimas tres elecciones (2002, 2006 y 2010), observando la presencia de diferentes tipos de capital político originario, particularmente el familiar. Los datos muestran que la presencia de la familia política es la segunda principal forma de acceso a la Cámara, tras el capital económico. Resulta más fuerte entre las mujeres, entre los elegidos por partidos de derecha y en la región Nordeste, aunque no es irrelevante para los hombres, para integrantes de partidos de izquierda o para las demás regiones del país.

            RÉSUMÉ Au Brésil comme dans d'autres pays, la carrière politique a un caractère endogène très marqué. De nombreux politiques y arrivent par l'entremise de parents ou conjoints occupant déjà des postes électifs ou des fonctions importantes au sein de l'Exécutif. Le présent article analyse les trajectoires politiques des députés fédéraux élus lors des trois derniers scrutins (2002, 2006 et 2010), ainsi que la présence de différents types de capital politique de base, et en particulier familial. Les données montrent que l'existence de politiques dans la famille est la seconde voie d'accès à la Chambre des Députés, juste après le capital économique. Ce facteur est prédominant parmi les femmes et les élus de droite, ainsi que dans la région Nordeste, mais n'est pour autant insignifiant chez les hommes, dans les partis de gauche ou dans les autres régions du pays.

            Political careers in Brazil, as in other countries, are highly endogenous. Many enter politics through their parents, spouses or other close relatives who already hold elected seats or other high positions in the Executive branch. This article analyzes the political strategies of elected officials for the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies in the last three elections (2002, 2006 and 2010), observing the presence of other types of original political capital, including familial. The data indicates that the existence of a political family is the second main entryway to the Chamber of Deputies, second to economic capital. This form of capital is stronger among women, among those elected by right-wing parties and those elected in the Northeast region, yet this is not less relevant for men, those elected by left-wing parties or in other regions of the country.},

            Abstract This article analyzes the political trajectory of 62 women who, during 17 legislatures, exercised at least three terms, with at least one being in the position of federal representative, in order to answer the following question: what are the necessary requirements for women to have successful parliamentary careers in a country that places 151st among 187 countries reviewed in terms of women's participation in parliaments in 2017? The article is divided into two parts: the first part gives a general overview of the universe of women elected state and federal representatives between 1950 and 2014, a total of 653 deputies. The second part focuses on the 62 women who at least once reached the federal congress, the main focus of this study. The analysis of the trajectories of the 62 deputies showed that their long political careers follow the same traditional paths as their male peers, a finding that points to one of the main reasons for the scarce presence of women in Brazilian political life.},

            This article presents the main results of a survey of candidates to Parliament, conducted within the research developed by the Consortium Bertha Lutz during the 2010 elections. It examines dimensions such as political trajectories and electoral strategies, resources and difficulties campaigns. The objective is to identify how gender is presented in possible intervening variables in these profiles. For this work we used two data sources: a survey sampling based on a structured questionnaire consisting questions regarding various individual and institutional dimensions, applied to Congress candidates in 14 states, and the data provided by applicants to the Superior Electoral Court . The statistical analysis for verification of hypotheses based on the Cluster Analysis. The results indicate that being male is associated with being or have already been parliamentary, be trying to re-election, have a reasonable time of political, owning militancy and have invested large resources in the election campaign. On the other hand, for a woman to have a campaign promising she should have a good political career and being inserted into social networking strategies. Based on the data, it is concluded that the strategy to achieve gender equality in Congress should follow these points: the parties, through consolidation of party experience, job positions public political forms of association and / or militancy and structuring networks or personal representative and, above all, availability of financial resources, or through personal networks and donations. The election process would therefore a result of a preceding filter even recruitment. Profiles elected, whether men or women, are similar, but as far as men are widely majority among the elect, we can say that these profiles are the result of a structure still marked by inequalities and values differentiated by gender.},

Following an analysis of how various models of party can be located in terms of the relationship between civil society and the state, we contend that the recent period has witnessed the emergence of a new model of party, the cartel party, in which colluding parties become agents of the state and employ the resources of the state (the party state) to ensure their own collective survival. Finally, we suggest that the recent challenge to party is in fact a challenge to the cartel that the established parties have created for themselves.},

Using data from two sets of European surveys, our study investigates this question to study longitudinal change in party membership. The data show a growing gap between the age of party members and the general population. In most other respects, however, party members seem to be becoming more, not less, like their fellow citizens. This suggests that today’s smaller but more powerful memberships still have the potential to help link their parties to a wider electoral base.},

Como as decisões são tomadas no interior dos partidos? Quais são os elementos que provocam transformações no desenho organizacional dos partidos políticos? Indagações como essas vêm sendo objeto de preocupação por parte de pesquisadores desde o início do século passado e uma longa tradição na Ciência Política foi construída desde o clássico trabalho de Michels, publicado em 1911. O objetivo deste artigo é descrever, sistematizar e discutir as principais contribuições da Ciência Política, tanto em âmbito internacional quanto nacional, para o estudo da organização dos partidos políticos. Para isso, nos concentramos nas abordagens que tratam, preferencialmente, da estrutura e do funcionamento interno e da relação com filiados e com organizações da sociedade civil.},

These new political formations tap into the potential of social media, and use online participatory platforms to include the rank-and-file. Paolo Gerbaudo looks at the restructuring of political parties in the time of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and campaigning based on Big Data. Drawing on interviews with key political leaders and digital organisers, he argues that the digital party is very different from the class-based 'mass party' of the industrial era. With new structures come worrying changes in political forms, such as the growth of power cliques and the need for centralised, charismatic leaders, the erosion of intermediary party layers and the loss of accountability. However, there is also a growth of strong unity at the centre and extreme flexibility at the margins, creating a promising template which could counter the social polarisation created by the Great Recession and the failures of liberal democracy."--Résumé de l'éditeur},

No primeiro momento, os tipos de representação e o sistema partidário são enfocados como dimensões do sistema político e eleitoral. Em seguida o sistema partidário é mais bem analisado em seus aspectos organizacionais e ideológicos. Com base na análise da literatura que aborda o tema, procura-se refletir sobre alguns condicionantes institucionais desses sistemas que interferem de maneira positiva ou negativa nas chances de as mulheres disputarem e se elegerem pelos partidos. No segundo momento, as experiências recentes de adoção de cotas por sexo para candidaturas proporcionais são inseridas na análise. A partir de pesquisa sobre o caso brasileiro, procura-se observar como as características do sistema partidário e os condicionantes discutidos podem afetar os resultados das cotas. As conclusões destacam que o acesso das mulheres à representação política é condicionado por um conjunto de fatores que ultrapassam a engenharia do sistema político, mas que tal engenharia tem um peso e pode favorecer mais ou menos o ingresso feminino na política. Como a pesquisa sugere, essa influência pode operar, também, sobre a possibilidade de que as cotas sejam assumidas de maneira mais burocrática ou mais efetiva pelos partidos brasileiros.

            Cet article discute la relation entre les opportunités d'accès à la représentation politique pour les femmes, principalement à la représentation législative, et les formes de leur insertion dans les partis politiques. Dans un premier moment, les types de représentation et le système de partis sont considérés comme des dimensions du système politique et électoral. Ensuite, le système de partis politiques est mieux analysé en ce qui concerne leur organisation et idéologie. En s'appuyant sur la littérature abordant ce thème, on réfléchit sur quelques contraintes institutionnelles de ces systèmes et qui interviennent positivement ou négativement dans les chances pour les femmes de disputer et d'être choisies par l'intermédiaire des partis. Dans un second moment, les expériences récentes d'adoption de quotas selon le sexe pour les candidatures proportionnelles sont examinées. A partir de l'étude du cas brésilien, on cherche à observer comment les caractéristiques du système de partis et les constraintes présentées puissent influencer les résultats des quotas. Les conclusions soulignent que pour les femmes l'accès à la représentation politique subit l'influence d'un ensemble de facteurs surpassant la dynamique du système politique. Cela est important et favorise assez bien l'accès à la vie politique. Comme la recherche suggère, cette influence peut agir aussi sur la possibilité de faire en sorte que ces quotas soient envisagés plus bureaucratiquement ou bien plus efficacement par les partis brésiliens.

            This article discusses the relationship between women's chances for access to political representation, in particular legislative representation, and their forms of participation in political parties. First, we look at types of representation and the party system, as dimensions of the political and electoral system. This is followed by an analysis of the political party system focusing on its organizational and ideological aspects. Based on the analysis of the literature that deals with our topic, we attempt to reflect on some of the institutional factors that within these systems have a negative or positive effect on women's chances to compete for electoral offices and be elected through political parties. This is followed by a second moment in which recent experiences of proportional quotas for the representation of both sexes have been implemented. Through research on the Brazilian case, we attempt to observe how the characteristics of the party system and the conditioning factors that we have discussed can affect the outcome of quota policies. Our conclusions show that women's access to political representation is conditioned by a complex of factors that go beyond the engineering of the political system, although efforts at engineering have an impact and can favor women's entrance into politics to a greater or lesser extent. As research has show, this influence can operate as well over the possibility that the quota system be implemented either more bureaucratically or more effectively by Brazilian political parties.},

	abstract = {O objetivo do trabalho é descrever e analisar a desigualdade de gênero nas eleições proporcionais de 2018 a partir dos seguintes parâmetros: i) o número de candidaturas masculinas e femininas; ii) o perfil sociodemográfico de candidatas e candidatos; iii) competitividade de mulheres e homens e, ainda, a relação entre votos; iv) e o volume de recursos financeiros de campanha declarados por candidatas e candidatos. A metodologia se deu com base em estatísticas descritivas dos dados brutos do Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE), avaliando parâmetros de candidaturas, competitividade e gastos. A análise desses parâmetros revela que os partidos cumpriram, à risca, o patamar mínimo de candidaturas femininas definido em lei, de 30\% de nomes nas listas partidárias. Além disso, observou-se um possível efeito do estado civil em interação com gênero desfavorável à representação feminina. Esse dado parece refletir, na arena eleitoral, constatações mais gerais a respeito da variação da desigualdade de gênero no Brasil associada à divisão sexual do trabalho reprodutivo. Para descrever a competitividade de candidatas e candidatos, foi elaborada uma tipologia a partir da regra que define o patamar mínimo de 10\% quociente eleitoral como requisito para obtenção de representação. Observou-se um expressivo contingente de mulheres subcompetitivas. Isso ajuda a explicar outro achado do artigo: o fato de que as vagas adicionais nos legislativos estaduais obtidos pela expressividade da votação de algumas poucas mulheres “puxadoras de votos” foram preenchidas, em geral, por homens. Por fim, o artigo revela que, considerando um mesmo volume de recursos de campanha, os homens, em sua grande maioria, recebem mais votos que as mulheres. A descrição da desigualdade de gênero, a partir das eleições proporcionais de 2018, dialoga diretamente com os principais temas da literatura sobre desigualdade de gênero na política. Espera-se que a análise empreendida no artigo contribua para o diálogo e ações que visem promover uma maior igualdade entre homens e mulheres na política brasileira.},

Conclui-se que há muita desigualdade dentro do grupo dos homens bem como dentro do grupo das mulheres. A maior parte da desigualdade dentro desses grupos está associada à polarização entre trabalhar ou não. Os trabalhos femininos, pago e não pago, são os que mais contribuem para a desigualdade total na sociedade. O trabalho doméstico masculino não é frequente e por isso contribui pouco para a desigualdade. Os principais determinantes do diferencial de gênero na duração das jornadas de trabalho são a proporção de pessoas que fazem trabalho pago e a duração do trabalho não pago. A divisão sexual do trabalho não é caracterizada por um espelhamento de atividades e, por isso, as mulheres invariavelmente trabalham mais que os homens, mesmo quando as desigualdades dentro dos grupos são consideradas.
          , 
            Abstract We examine gender inequalities in time use in Brazil by decomposing the total time employed in work in paid (market) and unpaid work (domestic). Data comes from the 2013 National Household Survey, Pnad. We found large inequalities within the subgroups of men and women. Most inequality within these groups is related to the polarization between working or not. Female work, both paid and unpaid, is what contributes more to total inequality in society. The domestic work among men is less common and, therefore, contributes little to total inequality. The main determinants of the gender differential in working hours are the proportion of people who do some paid work and the duration of unpaid work. The sexual division of labor is not characterized by a mirroring of activities. Therefore, women invariably work more than men, even when within group inequalities are considered.},

A análise é feita por gênero e tem como base a Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de Domicílios (PNAD), do Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE). Os resultados revelam que os homens desfrutam de mais horas de lazer do que as mulheres, ainda que haja uma tendência de redução dessa diferença ao longo do tempo. Há uma elevação do tempo dedicado ao lazer para ambos os sexos, mas este aumento se dá de forma mais acentuada para as mulheres. Os resultados mostram ainda que a ampliação do número de horas de lazer ao longo do período foi ocasionada por razões diversas entre homens e mulheres. Para eles, a elevação do lazer (de quatro horas semanais) pode ser explicada pela redução expressiva nas horas trabalhadas no mercado, enquanto para elas, o ganho de sete horas semanais de lazer deve-se à redução nas horas dedicadas aos afazeres domésticos.},

	abstract = {In recent years a rich outpouring of case studies on community decision-making has been combined with a noticeable lack of generalizations based on them. One reason for this is a commonplace: we have no general theory, no broad-gauge model in terms of which widely different case studies can be systematically compared and contrasted.
            Among the obstacles to the development of such a theory is a good deal of confusion about the nature of power and of the things that differentiate it from the equally important concepts of force, influence, and authority. These terms have different meanings and are of varying relevance; yet in nearly all studies of community decision-making published to date, power and influence are used almost interchangeably, and force and authority are neglected. The researchers thereby handicap themselves. For they utilize concepts which are at once too broadly and too narrowly drawn: too broadly, because important distinctions between power and influence are brushed over; and too narrowly, because other concepts are disregarded—concepts which, had they been brought to bear, might have altered the findings radically.
            
              Many investigators have also mistakenly assumed that power and its correlatives are activated and can be observed only in decisionmaking situations. They have overlooked the equally, if not more important area of what might be called “nondecision-making”,
              i.e.
              , the practice of limiting the scope of actual decisionmaking to “safe” issues by manipulating the dominant community values, myths, and political institutions and procedures. To pass over this is to neglect one whole “face” of power.},

We examine whether, as established for the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies, this kind of professional politician settles mostly in the parties on the right of the ideological spectrum and whether or not the connection between their social backgrounds and the parties they take part eventually shorten their ways to the Senate. For that, we use descriptive analysis of occupation, education, and political career data of 240 senators elected between 1986 and 2010. Our data show that even though they belong to Center and Right parties, senators who were businessmen do not have shorter careers, showing that the pattern of political career for that office is different from that observed for the Chamber of Deputies.},

	abstract = {O artigo discute a relação entre as chances de acesso das mulheres à representação política, particularmente à representação legislativa, e as formas de sua inserção nos partidos políticos. No primeiro momento, os tipos de representação e o sistema partidário são enfocados como dimensões do sistema político e eleitoral. Em seguida o sistema partidário é mais bem analisado em seus aspectos organizacionais e ideológicos. Com base na análise da literatura que aborda o tema, procura-se refletir sobre alguns condicionantes institucionais desses sistemas que interferem de maneira positiva ou negativa nas chances de as mulheres disputarem e se elegerem pelos partidos. No segundo momento, as experiências recentes de adoção de cotas por sexo para candidaturas proporcionais são inseridas na análise. A partir de pesquisa sobre o caso brasileiro, procura-se observar como as características do sistema partidário e os condicionantes discutidos podem afetar os resultados das cotas. As conclusões destacam que o acesso das mulheres à representação política é condicionado por um conjunto de fatores que ultrapassam a engenharia do sistema político, mas que tal engenharia tem um peso e pode favorecer mais ou menos o ingresso feminino na política. Como a pesquisa sugere, essa influência pode operar, também, sobre a possibilidade de que as cotas sejam assumidas de maneira mais burocrática ou mais efetiva pelos partidos brasileiros.

            Cet article discute la relation entre les opportunités d'accès à la représentation politique pour les femmes, principalement à la représentation législative, et les formes de leur insertion dans les partis politiques. Dans un premier moment, les types de représentation et le système de partis sont considérés comme des dimensions du système politique et électoral. Ensuite, le système de partis politiques est mieux analysé en ce qui concerne leur organisation et idéologie. En s'appuyant sur la littérature abordant ce thème, on réfléchit sur quelques contraintes institutionnelles de ces systèmes et qui interviennent positivement ou négativement dans les chances pour les femmes de disputer et d'être choisies par l'intermédiaire des partis. Dans un second moment, les expériences récentes d'adoption de quotas selon le sexe pour les candidatures proportionnelles sont examinées. A partir de l'étude du cas brésilien, on cherche à observer comment les caractéristiques du système de partis et les constraintes présentées puissent influencer les résultats des quotas. Les conclusions soulignent que pour les femmes l'accès à la représentation politique subit l'influence d'un ensemble de facteurs surpassant la dynamique du système politique. Cela est important et favorise assez bien l'accès à la vie politique. Comme la recherche suggère, cette influence peut agir aussi sur la possibilité de faire en sorte que ces quotas soient envisagés plus bureaucratiquement ou bien plus efficacement par les partis brésiliens.

            This article discusses the relationship between women's chances for access to political representation, in particular legislative representation, and their forms of participation in political parties. First, we look at types of representation and the party system, as dimensions of the political and electoral system. This is followed by an analysis of the political party system focusing on its organizational and ideological aspects. Based on the analysis of the literature that deals with our topic, we attempt to reflect on some of the institutional factors that within these systems have a negative or positive effect on women's chances to compete for electoral offices and be elected through political parties. This is followed by a second moment in which recent experiences of proportional quotas for the representation of both sexes have been implemented. Through research on the Brazilian case, we attempt to observe how the characteristics of the party system and the conditioning factors that we have discussed can affect the outcome of quota policies. Our conclusions show that women's access to political representation is conditioned by a complex of factors that go beyond the engineering of the political system, although efforts at engineering have an impact and can favor women's entrance into politics to a greater or lesser extent. As research has show, this influence can operate as well over the possibility that the quota system be implemented either more bureaucratically or more effectively by Brazilian political parties.},

            ABSTRACT The aim of this article is to analyze the connections between the sexual division of labor, understood here as a fundamental factor in the production of gender, and the limits of contemporary democracies. The analysis is supported by extensive literature on the subject, accompanied by empirical contributions that allow us to situate the discussion in the Brazilian context. Two axioms and one guiding hypothesis form the three main sections of the article, as follows: (A1) the sexual division of labor is at the heart of gender hierarchies in contemporary societies; (A2) these hierarchies assume different forms according to women’s class and race; (H) the resultant discrepancies – particularly in the form of unequal access to leisure time and income – restrict women’s political participation. Recognition of the impact of the sexual division of labor is made according to a broad vision of politics that takes into account everyday power relations. The analysis highlights how these relations combine to affect access to the political system, in order to help construct theoretical models that incorporate this fundamental dimension of gender relations, the sexual division of labor, and the critical analysis of the limits of democracy.

            RESUMEN El objetivo de este artículo es analizar la relación existente entre la división sexual del trabajo, aquí entendida como un factor fundamental en la producción del género, y los límites de las democracias contemporáneas. El análisis se apoya en la extensa literatura disponible sobre el tema, acompañado de un aporte empírico que permite situar la discusión en el contexto brasileño. Es orientado por dos axiomas y una hipótesis, los cuales corresponden a las tres secciones principales del artículo: (A1) la división sexual del trabajo está en la base de las jerarquías de género en las sociedades contemporáneas; (A2) esas jerarquías asumen formas diferenciadas según la posición de clase y la raza de las mujeres; (H) las asimetrías así constituidas, entre las cuales se destacan el acceso desigual al tiempo libre y a la renta, limitan la participación política de las mujeres. El reconocimiento del impacto de la división sexual del trabajo se hace en una concepción ampliada de la política, que toma en cuenta las relaciones de poder en la cotidianeidad. El análisis resalta la manera en que esas relaciones inciden en el acceso al sistema político. Busca de esta forma colaborar con la construcción de modelos teóricos que incorporen esa dimensión fundamental de las relaciones de género, la división sexual del trabajo, al análisis crítico de los límites de la democracia.

            RÉSUMÉ L’objectif de cet article est d’analyser les connexions entre la division sexuelle du travail, ici entendue comme un facteur fondamental de la production du genre, et les limites des démocraties contemporaines. Notre analyse s’appuie sur l’abondante littérature du domaine et sur un apport empirique permettant de situer le débat dans le contexte brésilien. Nous avons émis deux axiomes et une hypothèse correspondant aux trois principales parties de cet article: (A1) la division sexuelle du travail est à la base des hiérarchies de genre dans les sociétés contemporaines; (A2) ces hiérarchies assument des formes différenciées en fonction de la position de classe et de l’origine ethnique des femmes; (H) les asymétries ainsi constituées, parmi lesquelles se distinguent l’accès inégal au temps libre et au revenu, limitent la participation politique des femmes. La reconnaissance de l’impact de la division sexuelle du travail implique une conception élargie de la politique qui prenne en compte les rapports de pouvoir au quotidien. Notre analyse souligne la manière dont ces relations jouent sur l’accès au système politique. Il s’agit ainsi de collaborer à la construction de modèles théoriques incorporant cette dimension fondamentale des rapports de genre, à savoir la division sexuelle du travail, à l’analyse critique des limites de la démocratie.},

            Abstract: This article analyzes the political trajectory of black feminist activism in Brazil and its discursive repertoires with respect to the intersections between gender, race and other social categories in three historical moments. The article is based on two research projects conducted between 2013 and 2019. The data presented in this article were collected through internal and journalistic documents from the Black Women’s Movement, government documents, informal conversations and semi-structured interviews with Black women activists from Belo Horizonte. The article is divided into three sections. First, we focus on the autonomization process of the Black Women’s Movement in the 1980s and analyze the discursive repertoires expressed in the Nzinga Informativo. Then, we analyze the movement’s institutional advocacy strategies in the 1990s and early 2000s. This period was characterized by an attempt to establish formal channels of political participation for Black women within the state bureaucracy and international organizations. Finally, we discuss the resurgence of street demonstrations in the 2010s, along with two emerging scenarios of political mobilization led by young black women activists in Brazil: (i) the rise of a generation of young black feminists who are reformulating and/or creating new discursive and confrontational repertoires in the streets, on the internet and in political representation; and (ii) the growing presence of black women exercising legislative mandates, which we interpret as a movement of “occupying politics”. By analyzing these discursive repertoires, this article contributes to a better understanding of the various strategies of political mobilization that black feminists employ in the early 21st century and the socio-political impact of these strategies.},

	abstract = {Systems theory has been challenged in the recent literature due to its perceived disconnection from today\&rsquo;s research and practice demands. Moving away from the reductionist frameworks and the complicated domain predominated by known unknowns and order, a call is being made to the social sciences to begin adopting complexity theory and newer connectionist methods that better address complexity and open social systems. Scholars and scholar-practitioners will continue to find the need to apply complexity theory as wicked problems become more prevalent in the social sciences. This paper differentiates between general systems theory (GST) and complexity theory, as well as identifies advantages for the social sciences in incorporating complexity theory as a formal theory. Complexity theory is expanded upon and identified as providing a new perspective and a new method of theorizing that can be practiced by disciplines within the social sciences. These additions could better position the social sciences to address the complexity associated with advancing technology, globalization, intricate markets, cultural change, and the myriad of challenges and opportunities to come.},

Building on the growing recognition that race and gender discrimination are not mutually exclusive phenomena, this background paper forwards a provisional framework to identify various forms of subordination that can be said to reflect the interactive effects of race and gender discrimination. It suggests a provisional protocol to be followed to better identify the occasions in which such interactive discrimination may have occurred, and posits further that the responsibility to address the causes and consequences of such discrimination be shared widely among all human rights institutions.},

O termo 'interseccionalidade' se refere às articulações entre a discriminação de gênero, a homofobia, o racismo e a exploração de classe. Falando do lugar de enunciação de mulheres de cor feministas situadas nos territórios geográficos dos Estados Unidos, as autoras enfatizam algumas questões-chave e tendências dos movimentos sociais que foram ignoradas pela mídia estadunidense. Alternativamente, o relatório examina como a introdução das 'intolerâncias correlatas' na agenda da Conferência permitiu discussões mais amplas sobre os efeitos da globalização no agravamento do racismo e sobre as múltiplas opressões com relação à orientação sexual e aos direitos sexuais. As autoras argumentam que uma insistência na significância do gênero e da raça, bem como da classe, no contexto do capitalismo neo-liberal, coloca novas e importantes coordenadas nos mapas do feminismo transnacional e do crescente movimento anti-globalização.

            This report examines 'intersectionality' as a feminist approach that significantly impacted the discourses and conversations that took place at the World Conference Against Racism and its parallel NGO Forum, in Durban, South Africa in 2001. The term 'intersectionality' refers to the links between gender discrimination, homophobia, racism and class exploitation. As women of color feminist scholars positioned within the geographic territories of the U.S., the authors specifically highlight key issues and social movement trends that were ignored by the U.S. media. Alternatively, this report focuses on how the conference framework of 'related intolerance' allowed for broader conversations on how racism is exacerbated by globalization as well as on multiple oppressions in relation to sexual orientation and sexual rights. The authors emphasize how an insistence on discussing the significance of race and gender as well as class, in the context of neo-liberal capitalism, puts important new coordinates on the maps of transnational feminist organizing and anti-globalization movement.},

            It appears to be beyond dispute that Brazilian politics is overwhelmingly White. Recent surveys indicate that the proportion of people of colour in the federal parliament is around 20\%. But despite such obvious marginalisation, little is known about the causes of this political under-representation. This paper attempts to shed light on the main filters driving out non-Whites, i.e. Blacks and Browns, from Brazilian politics. To this end, we have carried out a survey of the skin colour of candidates to a seat in the City Council of Brazil’s two largest cities: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in the 2012 elections. Given the lack of official records on the race or skin colour of these candidates, we chose to submit their photos, made publicly available by the Supreme Electoral Court, to classification by a team of researchers. The results have allowed us to gauge the extent to which the political alienation of non-White Brazilians is due to: (a) bias in party recruitment; (b) differences in educational capital and personal wealth between White and non-White candidates; (c) inequalities in the distribution of party and electoral resources; or (d) the electoral preferences of voters themselves. Apparently, the electoral opportunities of Blacks and Browns reflect the difficulties that these groups face when trying to ascend to the small elite of candidates that have the biggest funding and the most votes.},

Finally, I conduct a qualitative analysis of electoral propaganda (banners, websites/blogs, Facebook/twitter pages, online videos) for transgender candidates. Both quantitative and qualitative data address the following questions: a) what are the similarities/differences between Transgender and LGB candidates' social profiles? b) are transgender candidates previously involved in LGBT activism or this is a new type of engagement in sexual politics? c) do they use their transgender identity (and their experiences of discrimination) as political capital)? d) do their political programs engage the demands of LGBT activism?},

Todavia, com o protagonismo assumido pelas empresas, a importância e o impacto das demais receitas têm sido pouco abordados. O objetivo aqui é preencher parte dessa lacuna, detalhando o quanto cada uma das fontes de recurso contribui para o total arrecadado e quanto os competidores diferem-se em volume de financiamento. Para isto, foram analisadas as contas eleitorais de candidatos à Câmara dos Deputados nas eleições gerais de 2010 e 2014. Metodologicamente, conjugou-se estatística descritiva e testes de diferenças de médias. Os resultados indicam que o desempenho eleitoral está associado não somente ao volume de receitas, mas também à elevada presença de alguns tipos de doadores, como pessoas jurídicas e partidos. O posicionamento em relação ao governo federal, entretanto, afeta o montante arrecadado, mas não é um bom critério para avaliar a forma com que os candidatos são financiados.

            Abstract Since 2006, when the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral (TSE) has publicly released the campaign finance of candidates, parties and committees, there has been a significant increase in the number of works that analyze the financing of campaigns in Brazil. However, with the role played by the companies, the importance and impact of other revenues have been little analyzed. The purpose here is to fill in part of this gap, detailing how much each of the resources contributes to the total collected and how much the competitors differ in funding. For that, the electoral accounts of candidates for the Câmara dos Deputados in the elections of 2010 and 2014 were analyzed. Methodologically, descriptive statistics and mean difference tests were combined. The results indicate that electoral performance is associated not only with the revenues volume, but also with the high presence of some types of donors, such as companies and parties. The candidate position in relation to the federal government, on the other hand, affects the mean of raised, but it is not a good criterion for evaluating the way in which the candidates are financed.},

As conferências internacionais promovidas pela Organização das Nações Unidas recomendam ações para eliminar as discriminações contra o sexo feminino em todos os campos de atividade, especialmente na educação. O hiato de gênero e o déficit educacional das mulheres sempre fizeram parte da realidade brasileira. Contudo, as mulheres conseguiram eliminar e reverter esse hiato ao longo do século XX. Este artigo tem como objetivo principal analisar quando se deu a reversão do hiato de gênero na educação no Brasil. Para isso, apresentaremos as informações educacionais dos censos demográficos de 1960 a 2000, segundo níveis de escolaridade, desagregadas por sexo e por coortes de nascimento. Essa metodologia nos permitirá acompanhar a evolução do hiato de gênero das coortes nascidas após 1890 até o ano 1995.

            The reduction of the gender gap and the improvement in female access to education were explicit objectives of the IV Conference on Women (1995), of the World Education Forum (2000) and of the Millennium Summit (2000). All International Conferences promoted by the United Nations Organization (UN) recommend actions to eradicate discrimination against women in all fields of activity, especially education. The gender gap and the education deficit among women have always been part of the Brazilian reality. However, women have been able to eliminate and reverse this gap throughout the 20th century. The main purpose of this article is to analyze when the reversion of the gender gap in Brazilian education occurred. In order to do so, we will present information obtained from demographic censuses from 1960 to 2000, based on schooling levels disaggregated by gender and birth cohorts. This methodology will allow us to track the evolution of the gender gap in birth cohorts after 1890 until 1995.},

Levantamentos recentes indicam que a proporção de negros no parlamento federal nunca ultrapassou os míseros 9\%. Mas a despeito dessa evidente marginalidade, pouco se sabe sobre as causas dessa sub-representação política. Este artigo pretende elucidar quais são os principais filtros que afastam os não brancos, pretos e pardos, da política brasileira. Para tal, foi feito um levantamento sobre a cor dos candidatos a vereador nas eleições de 2012 nas duas maiores cidades brasileiras: São Paulo e Rio de Janeiro. Diante da carência de registros oficiais sobre a raça ou cor desses candidatos, optamos por submeter suas fotos, disponibilizadas pelo TSE, à classificação de uma equipe de pesquisadores. Os resultados permitiram entender até que ponto o alheamento político dos não brancos brasileiros se deve: (i) a vieses no recrutamento partidário; (ii) às diferenças de capital educacional e patrimônio entre os candidatos brancos e não brancos; (iii) às desigualdades na distribuição dos recursos partidários e eleitorais; ou (iv) às próprias preferências eleitorais dos votantes. Ao que parece, as chances eleitorais dos pretos e pardos refletem as dificuldades que esses grupos têm em ascender à pequena elite de candidatos que possuem os maiores financiamentos e as maiores votações.

            It seems beyond controversy that national politics in Brazil is mostly white. Recent assessments indicate that the proportion of blacks in the federal parliament has never exceeded a mere 9\%. Despite this apparent marginalization, there is scant information about the causes of this political under-representation. This article aims to clarify the filters that keep non-white, black and brown people out of Brazilian politics. Therefore, an evaluation was conducted on the colors of candidates running for city councilor in the 2012 elections in the country's two largest cities: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Given the lack of official records on the race or color of those candidates, we decided to submit their photos provided by the Electoral Supreme Court, to be classified by a team of researchers. The results allowed understanding to what extent the political alienation of non-white Brazilians is a result of: (i) biases in party recruitment; (ii) differences in educational capital and property between white and non-white candidates; (iii) inequalities in the distribution of party and electoral resources; or (iv) voters' own electoral preferences. Apparently, the electoral chances of blacks and browns reflect those groups' difficulties to ascend to the small elite of candidates who have the largest funds and most votes.},

Será considerado até que ponto o argumento por maior inclusão de membros de grupos sociais não hegemônicos em processos político-decisórios, através de mecanismos como as cotas, pode ser justificado desde uma perspectiva normativa. Dado o caráter polêmico do conceito de representação política e da noção de identidades e interesses de grupos, em que se justificaria essa demanda? Esta discussão será conduzida a partir de uma análise sobre o conceito de representação política, da noção de interesses, identidades e perspectivas de grupos, e de uma análise sobre os principais argumentos apresentados a favor das cotas e contra elas. O artigo foca na representação política das mulheres, estabelecendo assim um diálogo permanente com e entre perspectivas feministas.

            This article focus on the debate of political representation, especial group representation, and the policy of quotas with the purpose of highlighting their main and most contentious arguments, exploring their inconsistencies, problematizing and establishing a dialogue between them. It will be considered to what extent the argument for the inclusion of non-hegemonic group members in the political decision making process, through means such as quotas, may be justified from a normative standpoint. Given the contentious character of the concept of political representation and of the notion of group identity and interest, to what extent could this demand be justified? This discussion will be carried out through a critical analysis on the meaning of political representation, the notion of group rights, interests, identities and perspectives, and the main arguments for and against quotas. The article will be centered on the debate about the political representation of women, establishing thus a close dialogue with and between feminist perspectives.},

	abstract = {Os deputados federais brasileiros têm cinco escolhas principais de carreira política: retirar-se do jogo político (aposentar-se); concorrer a um cargo legislativo estadual (ambição regressiva); concorrer à reeleição (ambição estática); e concorrer a cargos mais altos (ambição progressiva). Este artigo monta um modelo para explicar as características das escolhas dos deputados com respeito a suas decisões de carreira na eleição de 1998. Sustentamos que não é a "natureza" da ambição política que determina a escolha, mas a avaliação dos riscos e custos contidos na decisão. Usou-se um modelo de regressão logit hierárquico para estimar o impacto das distintas estratégias políticas utilizadas pelos deputados em seus mandatos e suas campanhas eleitorais. Os principais resultados sugerem que os deputados com diferentes escolhas de carreira apresentam distintas estratégias durante seus mandatos, o que influencia decisivamente suas preferências do que fazem para sobreviver politicamente.

            The Brazilian incumbent legislators have five major choices of political career: to withdraw from the elected political game (to retire); to run for local legislative position (regressive ambition); to run for re-election (static ambition); and to run for higher offices (progressive ambition). This paper built a model to explaining the features of incumbent legislators choices regarding their career's decisions in 1998's Brazilian election. We argue that it is not the "nature" of political ambition that determines legislators' choice, but the evaluation of the risks and costs entailed in the decision. The main findings suggest that incumbents with different career's choices present distinct strategies during their mandates, which have decisive influences on their preferences of what they do in order to survive politically.},
